Zoom Yummers</strong></p><p align="justify">



My two preschool entrepreneurs quickly agreed on the name of their 
future restaurant, "Zoom Yummers.” Spurred on by the advice I 
found in the parenting books—“Encourage their creativity”— what 
followed were many days of recipe development.</p><p align="justify">

Darren, always the equipment man, ensured that his recipes 
utilized the maximum number of pots, pans, utensils and 
appliances. Anything electrical and noisy had the advantage of 
being able to drown out the non-stop narrations of his older 
brother at the push of a button. He discovered the magic of the 
slotted spoon—the perfect instrument for lifting the muffin batter 
(cornflakes, raisins and BBQ sauce) out of its apple juice 
marinade. Spread the batter across the muffin tin, bake in a 
preheated 350°F oven until dried out or the thinner parts 
blacken.</p><p align="justify">

Brendon, who always had an artistic flare, developed recipes with 
interesting colours and textures, ones that felt good when mixed 
by hand. A bottle of paprika did wonders for his otherwise bland 
looking porridge (oatmeal, icing sugar and mayonnaise).</p><p align="justify">

I learned early on what my roles were to be in this venture. I was 
not to be the CFO. My comments on the price of pecans went 
unheeded as an entire bag disappeared into the balsamic vinegar 
soup. Nor was I allowed to comment on the advantages of small 
amounts of certain ingredients such as peppermint extract. Darren, 
who was testing the "bigger is better" philosophy, still insisted 
on pouring the entire bottle into his icing. He was, in fact, 
correct—I could only detect a subtle nuance of peppermint in the 
final product. Maybe grinding the whole bottle of pepper into the 
icing "to add speckles, Mummy!" somehow neutralized the extract.</p><p align="justify">

Brendon went through an equal rights phase (pancakes: 1 cup flour, 
1 cup milk, 1 cup sugar, 1 cup salt). I occasionally had to remind 
myself what the parenting gurus preached—"Let them learn from 
their mistakes."</p><p align="justify">

"Mummymummymummy I NEED some flour!" came a request from one of 
the chefs standing on his chair while stirring a soggy looking 
batter. One of my jobs was to fetch the hard-to-reach ingredients. 
I found a long forgotten bag of Kamut flour. "This flour is from 
an ancient Egyptian grain,” I explained. "Mummy what is Gipshun?" 
I got out our world globe and sticky fingers soon found where we 
live and the location of Egypt. A brief lesson in geography, 
wildlife and literature ensued. Fingers dipped into the flour, 
were licked, the chefs debated, then passed a motion that allowed 
Gipshun flour. Thus an international flare to Zoom Yummers was 
born with the first batch of<em>Lyle Lyle Crocodile</em> Cookies. I 
secretly made plans to unload the rest of my aged and neglected 
food-stuffs to this worthy cause.</p><p align="justify">

One of my other jobs was to chauffeur the boys and their precious 
dishes into town to their customer. Proudly clutching what they 
had created they would run into his office exclaiming, "Dadn, we 
made you LUNCH!" Dadn, relishing his role as taste tester and 
customer soon learned to ask the chefs and chauffeur to join him 
in eating his special meal. For some reason we were often all 
surprisingly full and could only eat a small amount from each 
dish. Chocolate chips, the most ubiquitous ingredient in their 
recipes, came to the rescue here.  We quickly learned to dig them out of the culinary delights for sampling.  They had the ability to retain their taste despite the other ingredients  they had had to rub 
shoulders with in the cooking process.</p><p align="justify">

All too soon the chefs would be back home for their afternoon 
naps. While they dreamed of Zoom Yummers I searched the parenting 
books for ideas on how get green food colouring out of linoleum 
and cat fur.</p><p align="center">
