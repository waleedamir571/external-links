Chen-ou Liu’s "The Distance of Love," A Commentary by Gerry Jacobson

</strong>
 
 
</p><p align="justify">

Liu’s piece pierces me: brings up the guilt. I walked out of my London home at 18, caught a train to Tilbury dock, emigrated to Australia, never saw my mother again.
 
</p><p align="justify">

I don’t recall she ever said she loved me. Her hands were full with younger children. But then I’m sure I never said I loved her.  But loved I was. It must have been so. Throughout life I’ve had that resilience: that feeling I was a little prince, cherished and admired.
  
</p><p align="justify">

How was it for her watching me stride off down the street with a rucksack on that grey winter’s day? Ostensibly going away for two years; in fact, forever. She died when I was 30, and I was another world away in the sunshine of Papua New Guinea. I don’t think I grieved. Just got on with my busy life: work, marriage, children.
  
</p><p align="justify">

And later when my own fledglings left our nest it was a chaotic time. My work was in demand. It was the 80s, the 90s, and teenagers entered a world of binge drinking, music, drugs, that I knew nothing about. And none of the three was on the straight path of school-uni-job. When they left home I think I swallowed my grief and just trusted.  And hoped.
 
</p><p align="justify">
 
I’m grateful to Chen-ou for opening up these feelings. And I’ve said nothing about his piece (which is reprinted below). Perhaps I don’t need to. It’s perfect. 
 
</p><p align="justify">
 
the spirit travels <br />
at the speed of a horse  <br />
so they say -<br />
mine has been galloping<br />
far too fast

  <p align="justify">
   
   Coming back home after my first day in grade one, I asked, <em>Mom, do you love me</em>? </p>
  <p align="justify">
   
   <em>I love you this much</em>, she said with a laugh, holding her hands half a meter apart. </p>
  <p align="justify">
   
   Now, forty years later, living in another country, I still can't fathom the depth of that L word inscribed in my mother's heart.
