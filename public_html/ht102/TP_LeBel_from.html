Weights & Measures</strong></p><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p align="justify" class="font12">




			‘la clarté spéciale que fait la mer.’</p><blockquote><blockquote><p align="justify" class="font12">—Paul Claudel,<em>Préface</em></p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><p align="justify">"Dear Jackson,<p align="justify">The spring sea off Tybee Island has bloomed into an enormous blue rose! Strong, steady winds ruffle the feathers of a large flock of terns crouching wing-to-wing on the sand, all facing the sea. With their orange and black faces, they resemble those strange creatures from the mind of Bosch.  A slim, shirtless boy runs through them, and like a cloud they part and re-gather a few yards down the beach. Bored with their easy compliance, the boy with his makeshift spear moves on.<p align="justify">While I crossed the low, arching bridges between islands, history's sleight-of-hand returned a day to me as if it had never passed. The pearl of sea-light hanging over the greening marshes betrayed an unseen beach still six miles east. Egrets stood along the silty banks of winding estuaries, snow-white visions of shape and grace, their lovely forms imbued with a touch of Eros, as Lucretius would insist.<p align="justify">And though I lived here years ago for just a while, I feel I've come full circle: isn't it odd, brother? Has some parallel life gone on living here without me? Will I meet her one day, that<em>other</em> girl when she's out and about on River Street wearing a secret smile, oblivious to all that will never touch<em>her</em>? Oh the 'what if' of that dream! always promising a finer savor than the taste of my present circumstances. Ah sweet delusion!<p align="justify">I can't explain why I love it here so much, this one place out of all the others that somehow built a fire beneath my ribs, ever calling me back.<p align="justify">And this time I heeded, I came, but I don't know exactly why; perhaps it’s the notion of being part of something larger than myself, even eternal, where all of time and life converges in a single breath we feel privileged, however briefly, to breathe . . . which may only be the gift that a nearness to the sea bestows so freely, and perhaps the real reason.<p align="justify">Love you, good, good brother,<br />
Caroline"<p align="justify"><em>"This my sister Caroline had written me the day she'd arrived and checked in to a small beachfront hotel on the island. By the following afternoon she's vanished without a trace, her luggage still unpacked in her room, her car abandoned on a side-street that dead-ended at the dunes, the parking meter long expired, a parking ticket tucked under the wipers.  I never learned of what those 'present circumstances' were. Her friends were mystified."</em><p align="justify"><em>Then Jackson passed me the letter. Caroline's handwriting was elegant, almost musical.</em><blockquote><p align="justify">'Dolphin days:<br />
	O what weights & measures<br />
	of sweet felicity come<br />
	when the scales refuse to tip<br />
	for the weight of one's private dark.'</p><blockquote><p align="justify"><em>How you were then, my sister,<br />
		merely a flicker behind my eyes:<br />
		through the late afternoon<br />
		in a car among hundreds<br />
                     I smile, remembering you . . . then . . .</em></p></blockquote></blockquote></td></tr></table><p align='center'><img src="#" width="750" height="2" alt="line" /></p><p align="center"><img src="#" width="300" height="40" alt="end" /></p><p align="center">|<a href="https://haibuntoday.thehaikufoundation.org/index102.html">contents page</a> |<a href="TP_Miller_Haru.html">next tanka prose</a> |</td></tr></table></td><td width="70" valign="top" ><img src="#" width="70" height="1200" alt="koi sidebar r" /><br /><img src="#" width="70" height="1276" alt="koi sidebar r" /></td></tr></table><tr><td ><map name="Map" id="Map"><area shape="rect" coords="174,122,267,139" href="https://haibuntoday.thehaikufoundation.org/index102.html" alt="contents" /><area shape="rect" coords="454,124,536,139" href="https://haibuntoday.thehaikufoundation.org/pages/archives.html" /><area shape="rect" coords="538,124,633,140" href="https://haibuntoday.thehaikufoundation.org/pages/resources.html" /><area shape="rect" coords="635,124,753,139" href="https://haibuntoday.thehaikufoundation.org/pages/submissions.html" /><area shape="rect" coords="754,122,823,141" href="https://haibuntoday.thehaikufoundation.org/pages/search.html" /><area shape="rect" coords="270,122,450,142" href="https://haibuntoday.thehaikufoundation.org/pages/about.html" /></map></body></html>
