Whatever You’d Like It to Mean:</strong></p><p align="justify" class="font12">Robert Motherwell’s Original Pen and Ink Template for His<em><br />
Elegy to the Spanish Republic</em> Series<span class="font12"></span><blockquote><p align="justify"><span class="font12">This preservation of favourable variations and the rejection of injurious variations, I call Natural Selection . . .</span></p><blockquote><blockquote><p align="justify"><span class="font12">	 —Charles Darwin</span></p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><p align="justify"><strong>1</strong><p align="justify">Harder by far to translate than even Chinese<em>hanzi</em>, three thick-brushed India ink pilasters and three black rough-edged ovoids here on white paper, and then, in a narrow box in the upper right, more rough inking over what appears to have been chirography.<p align="justify">All this sits in the bottom half of an 8½ x 11-inch page with a thick black bar across the top in the upper half (obliterating still more handwriting?).  Between these two disparate fields of blackness are three lines of roughly scrawled and incoherent poetry:<blockquote><p align="justify"><em>I know who had sent them in these<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
green cases.<br />
Who doesn’t lose his mind will receive<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
like me<br />
That wire in my neck up to the ear.</em></p></blockquote><p align="justify">A thin black ink line has been drawn with a pen to separate the two largest ovoids, which appear, at their edges, to be<em>paramecia</em> with their<em>celia</em> visible under the microscope.<p align="justify">The three black columns squeeze inward to the center, wedging the three black daubs up between them, so they look like shadow riders on the Gravitron.<p align="center">dark philosophy<br />
its layers peeled back one by one<br />
revealing the core<br />
everything comes down to this<br />
arranged in twos and threes<p align="center">stare at surfaces<br />
long enough and your eye slips through<br />
gazing all around<br />
at the undersides of things<br />
places where the meaning hides<p align="justify"><strong>2</strong><p align="justify">The deception (and isn’t all art deception?) underlying the<em>Elegies</em> comes in right here.  The artist wants these marks to “mean” something, to stand for hate, for violence, for death, for glory.  But, what exactly are the mechanics by which such rough black figures come to mean anything?  What happened to the poem-fragment’s lexicography of its<em>green cases</em> and the<em>wire in the neck</em>?<p align="justify"><em>He [Harold Rosenberg] wrote a very powerful, brutal, I would think Rimbaud-inspired poem.  We agreed that I would handwrite the poem in my calligraphy and make a drawing or drawings to go with it and it was to be in black and white.  So I began to think not only about getting the brutality and aggression of his poem in some kind of abstract terms but also that this was going to be reproduced in black and white . . .”</em><p align="justify">Now we are getting somewhere!  These black and white figures will become abstract reflections of<em>brutality</em> and<em>aggression</em>?  All words and writing were to begin with—abstract, I mean; they become concrete and mean specific things by consensus, following the teacher’s pointer from word to picture and back.<p align="center">you look at a thing<br />
long enough it can become<br />

teabags drying in a cup<br />

somehow, the rough roundedness<br />
and the black columns;<br />
I say they symbolize<br />
darkness in<em>das Unbewusste</em><p align="justify"><strong>3</strong><p align="justify">Anyway, they also remind me of the polished black leather<em>tricornio</em> worn by the<em>Guardia Civil</em>in Spain.  Or am I reasoning backwards?  I don’t think he had that in mind; at first these bars and ovals didn’t really mean anything, and certainly not the death of Spanish poets or liberty.<p align="justify"><em>One day I realized there was something really obsessional about it [the black and white template], that I would probably make many; that it had taken on a life of its own; and that it would no longer be legitimate to refer it merely to Harold's poem which indeed was the original impulse that it might indeed turn out to be possibly the main statement I would make in painting and therefore I would like to connect this with something that through associations reverberated in my mind as completely and as widely as the concept itself . . . And then I began to grope for a more generalized expression.</em><p align="justify">All at once the little sketch was bigger than it looked, and had become the idea of a lifetime, his own Mount Rushmore, some spontaneously off-the-wall thing now destined to mean, well, mean something—important!<p align="justify">A spring to go to, over and over, to take long drinks, rub the back of his hand across his mouth, pick up the brush, and get back to work.<p align="center">name what you wanted<br />
it to become, an invention called<br />
“you’ll never forget”<br />

overlooking its provenance<p align="center">these marks were pregnant<br />
with their later monumental<br />
heirs and descendants<br />
singing all about each other<br />
echoing the same old song<p align="justify"><strong>4</strong><p align="justify">There wasn’t anything to come that wasn’t already here in the first quick pen and ink.  An idle moment’s sketching (doodling, really), and what the hell!  This new idea tumbles out onto the table.  Isn’t that a dream come true?  You’re just going along, caught up in some little<em>what’ll-you-do</em>, and an idea emerges on its own, and idea for a life’s work.<p align="justify">Intrigued by the forms, Motherwell scaled up the motif into a casein painting entitled<em>At Five in the Afternoon</em> 1949 (Collection Helen Frankenthaler), after Federico Garcia Lorca’s poem &quot;mourning the death of a bull-fighter&quot; [sic].  The same year, Motherwell produced<em>Granada</em> 1949 (Collection Nelson A. Rockefeller, New York), his first major instance of what would later become the series of Elegies.  Motherwell defined the series in 1951 as “an attempt to compose a subjective image of modern Spain.  They are all in black and white: celebrations of death.”<p align="justify">No, they are not celebrations of death!  They are not the image of modern Spain!<p align="justify">Let me tell you a fairy story.  There was a maiden stepped accidentally into the mud and ruined her beautiful gown.  A tall modern-day and bored gallant stood idly to the side, well out of sight.  He never intended to rush heroically to her side, cast his cape into the dirt, and offer her his arm.<p align="justify">But, he had imagined it, and that was the story he was going to tell!<p align="center">don’t forget the “wire<br />
in my neck up to the ear”<br />
bleakest nihilism<br />
where nothing at all is true<br />
