<p align="JUSTIFY">
It is one of those days when the sun takes a while to burn off the clouds. My brother, Dorji and I are on an errand to the old shaman’s cave.


<p align="JUSTIFY">
Our family has been dogged by illness. We barely recover from hallucinatory fevers when grandfather goes down with a severe bout of uncustomary lassitude. Our well dries up. Soon our rice terraces become barren.


<p align="JUSTIFY">
‘Wait until the shaman finishes the offering. Bring back his amulets,’ grandfather says.


<p align="JUSTIFY">
From each bend of the mountain path we see the glinting twist of the river in the distance and, above us, the jagged peaks. There is no wind. A stillness bears down on us. In a yak-hide bag we carry sandalwood incense, fresh butter, fruits, a <em>khada</em><sup>*</sup> and some money. The shaman’s cave is a shrine. We have eaten no food on this pilgrimage. We share a cane jar of water.


<p align="JUSTIFY">
The only sound that accompanies our trek over the ridge is the tingling-tongling of yak bells in the folds of the slope. We can hear ourselves breathe.


<p align="JUSTIFY">
Dorji strides steadily ahead of me. My lungs hurt and my heart thumps in my head.


<p align="JUSTIFY">
‘Nearly there,’ he says and disappears behind a boulder.


<p align="JUSTIFY">
The sun is aloft on the mountain. White light blazes off the rocks. A <em>griffon</em><sup>**</sup> glides low overhead. Its cackle echoes around us. In a darkening swoop it uncurls its talons and grabs the yak-hide bag on Dorji’s shoulder. Dorji hangs for a long moment at the edge of the vertiginous cliff.


<p align="JUSTIFY">
My feet seem fastened onto the rock. I open my mouth but no sound comes out. Noiselessly the griffon drops the bag at the entrance of the shaman’s cave. 


<p align="JUSTIFY">
The shaman kneels before the hovering bird and cries: ‘The gods have accepted your offerings. Your family has nothing to fear. Return in peace.’
