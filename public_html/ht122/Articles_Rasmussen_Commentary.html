Editor's Challenge: Do a Personalized Commentary for Our Next Issue</strong></p>
<p align="justify">
I’m issuing a challenge to our readers to consider contributing a personal commentary on anyones’s work that appears in this issue. You pick the writer. I’ll post all commentaries I receive in our next issue.

</p><p align="justify">
In issuing this challenge, I realize that commenting on someone else’s work can be a daunting task. Most of us struggle with getting our own writing in good-enough shape to submit to a journal editor. And, for good reason, many of us are shy about commenting on another person’s writing because some writers have very thin skins.

</p><p align="justify">
But I’m not asking for a feedback-type commentary that points out problems with another person’s work, and particularly not high-end literary criticism – the formal analysis that our English instructors asked for in high school and university classes. </p>
<p align="justify">Instead, I’m more interested in inviting personal comments on the piece selected, what it brought to you, the commentator, in terms of your life experiences, past and present. What similar experiences does the selected piece bring to mind? </p>
<p align="justify">

The comments don't have to be more than a few paragraphs. Getting into a detailed literary analysis isn’t necessary, or even wanted, particularly if it would discourage you from offering your personal take on the piece you select.


</p>
<p align="justify">Why do this? I think its important for readers to share how haibun compositions speak to them personally. And it's important for the writers to learn how their work affects readers. After all, we hardly ever get feedback of this or any type.</p>
<p align="justify">To provide a clearer idea of what I have in mind, I've put up <a href="Articles_Rasmussen_Coats.html">a personal commentary on Glenn Coats' haibun</a>, &quot;Mentor,&quot; found in this issue.</p>
<p align="justify">
So please consider giving it a try. What do you have to lose?
