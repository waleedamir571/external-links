I was, I am, I shall be!
			<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;–Rosa Luxemburg </p>
<p align="justify">
 Once more the robin, setting rubies on the air, somehow bright, somehow plaintive to this human ear.  Then the crow, emptying its craw of darkness; whether it does through joy or woe I cannot tell, for I have yet to learn the tongue of corvids.
 
 
</p>
<p align="justify">
Is this blinkered luxury listening to the after-rain songs of the birds at dawn, here, now, far from Rohingya, yet within the reach of another Cold War?  In the pauses, it’s another time, another voice I hear. . . .

</p><p align='center'>


whiter than moonlight<br />
poplars in the gloaming<br />
and if I recall<br />
the song of a blackbird<br />
more jasmine than breeze?

</p><p align='center'>


then some other dusk<br />
that dull, lacklustre cry—<br />
lately, I heard it here<br />
and learned it is the wryneck<br />
who eats only ants

</p><p align='center'>


above the thunder<br />
a silver key in the lock . . .<br />
a nightingale<br />
drunk on rain<br />
<em>Oh, wert thou here!</em> </p>
<p align='center'>


the cast-ron calls<br />
of roostbound rooks<br />
over the yard<br />
where the prisoners bear<br />
the pots for supper

</p><p align='center'>


little butterfly<br />
if I take you to the sill<br />
to sip on nectar<br />
will you heed the black-cap’s tune<br />
and remember your wings?

Author’s Notes:<br /><br />
Rosa Luxemburg (1871-1919), Marxist theorist, philosopher, economist and Revolutionary Socialist of Polish-Jewish descent.  In February 1915, Luxemburg was sentenced to twelve months in Barnimstrasse Women’s Prison for an anti-war speech delivered to workers at Fechenheim, near Frankfurt.  She was released in February 1916, but her continued anti-war work drew unwanted attention and she was arrested again in July of that year and placed under &quot;protective custody&quot; for the remainder of the war, first in Wronke Fortress, then in the prison at Breslan.
<br /><br />
The epigraph is drawn from what are believed to be her last known words, written on the evening of her murder.  While incarcerated, Luxemburg wrote frequently to her long-time friend Sophie Liebknecht (wife of the Revolutionary, Karl Liebknecht, who would also die at the hands of paramilitaries on the same night as Luxemburg in January 1919).  The birds she glimpsed and heard, particularly in Wronke, were both a constant and a comfort in her confinement and she often spoke of them in her correspondence.
