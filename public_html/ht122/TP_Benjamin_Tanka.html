Tanka Diary
Visit to the Old Country</strong>

</p><p align="justify">




Day 1

</p>
<p align="justify">
We spend our first day back in Chennai, cleaning the house and setting ourselves up for our stay.  Internet to be reconnected, phones charged with credit, floor and benches and vessels washed, water cylinders bought, drinking water boiled.


</p><p align="justify">
A restaurant has opened recently directly across the street.  Its convenience entices us for a meal.


</p><p align="center">through the plate glass<br />
 of <em>Geetha Bhavan</em> windows<br />
a healing green wall—<br />
sprawling neem trees<br />
my husband’s father planted


</p><p align="justify">
Day 2

</p><p align="justify">
First thing, as every day, I open the bedroom window overlooking the adjacent vacant block.  No wind in the trees.  Grass straggles a metre high around an uncovered well.  Above, the sky is pale yellow and featureless.


</p><p align="justify">
The washing machine will not spin.  Clothes sit heavy in the bowl.


</p><p align="justify">
We are both lethargic.  Here to complete some family business, we lack direction.


</p><p align="center">in my dream<br />
I’m swaying on the rim<br />
of a swamp—<br />
weeds creep down<br />
into an abandoned well


</p><p align="justify">
We wait for a company representative to come to assess the machine.  He leaves and we wait again for someone to do the repairs.


</p><p align="center">the mechanic strips<br />
the washing machine<br />
down to bolts and bits<br />
slowly reconstructing <br />
a smoothly running life


</p><p align="justify">
Day 3

</p>
<p align="justify">
Morning chores: walk, greet neighbors, buy paper and a sachet of milk, boil milk and set the curd, heat water for a bath, bathe and dress, make breakfast, wash up, wash and hang the clothes, clean the floor and steps, check my emails, check my WhatsApp messages from home.  When I can, I spend some time on the roof.


</p><p align="center">a congress of crows<br />
converges on the terrace<br />
near the water tank<br />
breezes between the treetops<br />
breathe open a quiet space


</p><p align="justify">
A sunny day.  Heat bounces back from the sand in the cemetery where my sister-in-law and-brother-in-law are buried.  He died within a year of her going.  We are here to remember them.


</p><p align="center">women pull saris<br />
over their heads<br />
in the heat<br />
grandchildren wreathe the graves<br />
with marigolds and red roses


</p><p align="justify">
Day 4

</p><p align="justify">
Even a good tanka couldn’t fix the washing machine.  It is still not spinning.


</p><p align="justify">
On a second visit to <em>Geetha Bhavan</em> I realise there is a gap in the wall of green neem across the front of our house, and some of the washing that we hang to dry on the terrace roof is clearly visible. </p><p align="center">filled with wind<br />
washing flutters in the sun<br />
upon the roof<br />
my underwear<br />
on the diners’ plates


</p><p align="justify">
We invite our neighbors to a meal to end the old year.  On the terrace roof, the evening is cool, and still quiet, only a few signs of fireworks in the sky.


</p><p align="justify">
Day 5

</p>
<p align="justify">
A round of visits across the city . . .


</p><p align="justify">
Morning tea with our good friends next door.  Lunch with an industrialist friend, his family, five dogs and twelve associates who come to felicitate him.  Afternoon tea with a former neighbor: at 84, he bubbles with characteristic enthusiasm about the environment, politics, society and values.


</p>
<p align="justify">
At our next stop, a 94-year-old friend invites us to his club to celebrate a friend’s birthday.  That friend, like our host, is gracious and intelligent, a former scientist with NASA and Vice-Chancellor.


</p><p align="center">new year pudding<br />
steeped and seasoned<br />
plump with spirit<br />
fire in their eyes<br />
dancing in their steps


</p><p align="justify">
Day 6

</p><p align="justify">
After dining on old friendships yesterday, I begin to come to life.


</p><p align="justify">
In the car, on a long day outside the city with many stops.  A call from home: things awry; our elder daughter is unwell.  I am stuck in a car in an Indian village.


</p><p align="center">stopping everywhere<br />
and journeying nowhere<br />
my heart<br />
reaches away<br />
somewhere else


</p><p align="justify">
Day 7

</p><p align="justify">
In the morning, the aftermath of sleeping with nightmares;  I wake jaded.  We are both out of sorts.  Still, our daughter is safe and well and in good care.  And the washing machine is working.


</p><p align="center">she pegs a screen<br />
of sheets and shirts and shawls<br />
along the line<br />
between the neem trees<br />
and the household wear and tear


</p><p align="justify">
Day 9


</p><p align="justify">
The day is pleasantly overcast with a cool breeze.  The downstairs family has hired a woman to sweep the paved yard.  She burns the leaves—filling the house with acrid smoke.  As afternoon darkens, I savor the cool scent of rain.

Neem trees are associated with many medicinal benefits.
