Marilyn Humbert’s “Grandparent’s Lament”, A Personal Commentary by Gerry Jacobson

</strong>
 
 
</p><p align="justify">

It’s 1st March and there’s a new issue of ‘Haibun Today’. I wonder who’s in it this time? Scanning the list of authors and titles, are there any fellow Aussies?  Yes, Marilyn Humbert is a regular contributor to HT and I’m attracted by the title of her haibun: “Grandparent’s Lament”. So I read it first. Well, I’m a grandparent too.
 
</p><p align="justify">

The enchantment of a great haibun.  The prose tells a brief story about a teenage grandson, and the haiku is a nature observation.  But what happens in that white line between prose and haiku?  The text is so understated, but raw emotion is transmitted and leaves me reeling. 
 
</p><p align="justify">

When my (our) first grandchild, Rosa, was born, I was in cardiac rehab after surgery, feeling vulnerable, and I wasn’t sure that I would live very long. I determined to enjoy her babyhood and early childhood, travelling from my Canberra home to her Sydney home constantly. It’s a four-hour train journey. So it was with her brother Isaac. They’re 12 and 10 now, and I’m still travelling.  
 
</p><p align="justify">

It’s not quite so easy with Emilia, who is 9 years old, and Eira, who is just 3. The Viking Princesses, I call them. It’s thirty hours in the air to Stockholm where they live, passing through ten time zones, and there’s a week of jetlag to live through each time, plus a change of seasons. I spend a month or so with them in the Swedish summer.
 
</p><p align="justify">

The princesses visited Australia this last Christmas holidays, and we had all four grandchildren together. It was a joyful and chaotic time, partly in Sydney, partly in Canberra, and at a rented house near the coast. Reading Marilyn’s haibun I find myself grateful that our four grandchildren are still ‘little ones’ and still like having us around. Her piece is a warning of what might happen as they grow into adolescence. However.
