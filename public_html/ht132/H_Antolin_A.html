<em>No one could have gone into your house and tapped your phones. The doors were not broken into. The windows were locked. Why would anyone want to do that, anyway? No one has any reason to tap your phones or tamper with your medicines. No one was following you or spying on you. The neighbor riding a bike was just riding a bike. Even if you never saw him riding a bike before, that doesn’t mean he is a spy. No one in the emergency room was “in” on any plot involving you. They weren’t looking at you. If they looked, it was only to wonder what part of your body was injured. None of the doctors are in “cahoots.” When did you start using that word, anyway? No one is in cahoots with anyone else. And no one implanted microchips in your eye. That technology doesn’t even exist. There is nothing wrong with the water. I showed you—I drank the tap water. I’m fine. The clocks haven’t been changed. Why would anyone come in and change them to Middle Eastern Time in the middle of the night and then change them back in the morning? Why would anyone go to that much trouble? No one is watching you through the window. No one is waiting for me in the parking lot. No one wants to hurt any of us. Look, you can watch through the window as I leave, and you can see that nothing will happen to me. </em>
