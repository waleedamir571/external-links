Tim Gardiner’s “Hollow,” A Commentary by Pravat Kumar Padhy

</strong>
 
 
</p>
<p align="justify">

Tim Gardiner expresses his feelings about rejections in his tanka prose, “Hollow”. He uses an ironic humour to reflect the poet's emotional urges when not achieving  success and suggests that 'failure' is not necessary due to one’s own limitations.</p>
<p align="justify"> I liked the inner strength Gardiner expesses through the joy of a rejuvenated writing spark. The schemata or mora patterns of tanka writing follow 5-7-5-7-7 (known as <em>sanjuichi</em>).  He posits a literary invention by reversing the tanka strophes; the last two lines, <em>shimo-no-ku,</em> at the beginning and the first three lines, <em>kami-no-ku</em>, in the last. The last line: ‘the submission window opens” infers no bracketed or restricted time for creative pursuits. </p>
<p align="justify">
I had composed many poems and short stories during the early seventies through eighties, primarily during my college days, in my mother tongue, Odia. I experimented various styles of writing such as poetry in the form of dairy “Dairy Kabita” (Diary Poem), incorporating numerical and graphical symbols in the poems namely “Sankhya” (number), “Bruta” (Circle) and stories in the form of letters.
  
</p>
<p align="justify">
 One of my earliest haibun was returned to me with comments from an editor and I felt a bit disappointed, &quot;hollow,&quot; as Gardiner's title suggests. Soon after, to my utter surprise, the same editor informed me that she accepted the same haibun. Regardless of the reason, the acceptance infused me enthusiasm because that was my first published haibun in English.</p>
<p align="justify">
 To quote Jeffrey Woodward, <em>Haibun Today</em>, Vol. 6, No. 2, June 2012, “Every good writer, to draft and revise his work satisfactorily, must be a fair editor in embryo and <em>every accomplished editor, in some similar sense, must be in possession, if not of personal literary talent, of a generous poetic spirit</em>…” </p>
<p align="justify">
Here's Albert Einstein’s apt quote, “Failure is success in progress.”

   Rejection after rejection enters my email inbox. Who do these editors think they are? Don't they recognise genius when they read it? They'll pay for their rebuttals. I've set myself up in a remote tepui. The piranha pool will come in handy for dispatching the poetic charlatans. With them out of the way, I'll launch an indie publishing house to monopolise the global poetry market. With the world crippled by a lack of high quality high-quality poems, I'll be free to publish whatever doggerel I wish.
