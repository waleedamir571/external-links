A Minor Injury                

</strong></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">


Some years ago I was hauled up in front of a medical committee, in order that I should be means tested for Invalidity Benefit, and found myself next in line to a young man, probably still in his teens, who had recently returned from Iraq. He was extremely nervous as this was the first time he'd ever had to: "face the bastards" in person. I took great pains to reassure him that, having so recently served his country, however minor he felt his injuries to be, he would be sure to qualify. Of course, I was lying through my teeth. It was only when he rose to go in that I noticed the crutches, resting on the chair to the far side of him. And that he only had the one leg.
