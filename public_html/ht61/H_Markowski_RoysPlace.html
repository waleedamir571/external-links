<p align="JUSTIFY">


 She lights another Marlboro, snaps a swizzle stick in half and throws  down  Mister  Johnny  Walker  Black like  a  first  team  all  pro,  All  American  Bar  Fly.  She  scans  me  from  North  to  South  and  from  East  to  West. "He wrecked me.  That miserable prick wrecked me. He took the  kids. He took the car. He took the credit cards. And, he  took Cheryl,  the  little  bitch  three  doors  down  who  shined  his  shoes  and  kissed  his  royal ass  every  time  I  sent  him  out  to  Luke's  Market  for  a  gallon  of  milk.  If  I  never  see  that  skirt-chasing  son  of a  bitch  again,  it'll  be  too  soon.  So  what  about  you  Mister  Handsome  Wrapped  In  Faded  Denim,  how  many women  did  you  fuck  over  after  you  fucked  'em  and  promised  them  the  world ?"
<p align="JUSTIFY">She  says  all  of  this  to  me  like  we've  been  best  friends  dating  all  the  way  back  to  the  days  of  teddy  bears,  tricycles,  jump  rope,  jacks,  and  tooth  fairies.  It  seems  to  me  like  we  do  know  each  other,  and  have  known each  other  on  intimate  terms  for  years. I don't say  a  word. I  turn  my  back  to  her,  and  to  my  mid  morning face  hanging  on  a  crucifix  between two  fifths  of  bad  whiskey  on  Roy's  long  dark  cherry  wood  bar,  still searching  for  the  reason  I  did  what  I  did  with  our  neighbor  Sheryl  for  three  months  before  and  after  Laura  had  the  twins  when  we  lived  happily  ever  after  on  Eureka  Avenue  in  Grand  Rapids.
