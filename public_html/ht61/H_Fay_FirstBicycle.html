First Bicycle

<p align="JUSTIFY">


For my ninth birthday, my parents gave me a beautiful red Hiawatha with coaster brakes. The next summer our street was repaved. Freshly laid, black asphalt! The last day of paving, my friends and I noticed an operator who wasn't paying much attention and slid in behind his compactor to enjoy a deliciously smooth bike ride.
<p align="JUSTIFY">
I didn't see the compactor reverse directions—Impact!—and I was lying face down, scraped and bleeding. My Hiawatha looked like abstract art. I put the wreck behind our garage and waited with it for dad. This was not going to be pretty. A man from the paving company arrived about the same time as dad.
<p align="JUSTIFY">
The paving company offered to pay my dad for my bicycle plus damages. Dad refused. He felt the accident was my fault and I had to learn to take responsibility. The man shook dad's hand and left.
<p align="JUSTIFY">
Picking up his lunch pail and heading up the steps, dad said, &quot;I hope you enjoyed it. That's the only bike you'll ever get from me.&quot; And it was.
