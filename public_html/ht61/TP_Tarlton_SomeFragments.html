blazing red hot<br />

on a soft breath, a rough touch

<p align="JUSTIFY">But, true love thrives only where there is wealth.  Soft flesh and hard breaths to idle the hours, sure, there is much pleasure in that.  But love, lasting love, with children and a fine house—money must be found for these things.

<p align="center">ADELA</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">But, what about your promises?  You said I drove you crazy, that you couldn't stay away.  You came to my window.  You lured me into the corrals.
