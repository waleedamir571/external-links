Eugene, Oregon: Mountains and Rivers Press, 2010. 8 ¾&rdquo; X 5 ¾,&rdquo; stitch-bound, 28pp. $15. ISBN 978-0-9793204-5-3. &nbsp;Available for $15 USD from http://mountains and rivers press.org</strong></p><p class="justify">This moving collection of 17 poems (free form with 1 sonnet), 3 haibun, 3 haiku, and 1 haiku sequence, records the reconciliation of Harter to the death of her husband Bill Higginson.</p><p class="justify">She does this through engaging basic elemental connections of the embodied psyche through the imagery of light, childhood, sea, dream, and transpersonal states in an idiom that nods to Emily Dickinson and metaphysical poetry.</p><p>The dedication page haiku:</p><table width="90%" border="0" align="center"><tr><td>evening rain—<br />
I braid my hair<br />
into the dark</td></tr></table><p>and the concluding haiku:</p><table width="90%" border="0" align="center"><tr><td>migrating geese<br />
calls pierce the dusk—<br />
my hands fall open</td></tr></table><p class="justify">enclose the collection with a connection of the embodied psyche to nature and a prayer of acceptance to the natural order of things.</p><p class="justify">There are memorable lines in the poems: &ldquo;Every day I translate your last breath&rdquo; (4); &ldquo;a bowl that lets the growing light / pass through its thickened glass&rdquo; (13).</p><p class="justify">The poems are deeply moving in their overlay of grief, love, memory, wonder, and reconciliation mediated by an encounter with basic metaphysical issues. Particularly moving are &ldquo;November&rdquo; where grief is read into the O&rsquo;Keeffe painting<em>A Black Bird</em><em>with Snow Covered Red Hills</em> (6), &ldquo;The Blue Bowl&rdquo; where loss is found in a simple once-shared object (13), and &ldquo;Forgetting Rain&rdquo; where a reconciliation provoked by dream and nature is offered (25).</p><p class="justify">The haibun &ldquo;Moon-Seeking Soup&rdquo; (8) is touching with its deep-seated drive to connect sensibility and basic human grounding in moon viewing and preparing soup: &ldquo;. . . I searched the sky, wanting to raise my face into white light.&rdquo;&nbsp; The concluding haiku offers a deftly simple reconciliation in a perfect linking, the seeking is found in one&rsquo;s very self:</p><table width="90%" border="0" align="center"><tr><td>moon-seeking soup—<br />
my own face reflected<br />
in the broth</td></tr></table><p class="justify">The haiku sequence &ldquo;Riding the Atlantic City Express Train to Manhattan&rdquo; (16) embodies also the adjustment of the psyche and love in and after grief:</p><table width="90%" border="0" align="center"><tr><td><p>train whistle—<br />
I remember the warmth<br />
of your hand</p><p>spring equinox—<br />
the train rocks side-to-side<br />
on polished rails</p></td></tr></table><p><em>Recycling Starlight</em> is a moving poetic account of love, memory, and transformation.</p><p align="center"><strong><img src="#
