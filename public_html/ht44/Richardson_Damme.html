Here, I’m in polder country—pollarded trees, their bare arms stretching forth from knotted shoulders, grow tall on reclaimed land, while boats on frozen canals are stranded mid-bob. I wander along cobbled streets past scores of small second-hand bookstores, for Damme’s been branded the Book Town of Flanders. Most are closed today, as it’s January 1st, a moment for looking forward with hope to the year ahead—only I’m still looking backwards with despair to the meal I ate in Ghent three evenings ago.</p><p class="centertalics"><em>windmill blades</em><br /><em>slicing the space between neck</em><br /><em>and navel</em></p><p class="justify">I find just one café open—a heated refuge from the wind hustling in off the North Sea. My tea comes served in a glass cup on a leaf-shaped saucer with a complementary portion of chocolate mousse. For three days I’ve ingested nothing but dry crackers and water so I approach with caution. Dip my fingertip in. Give a tentative lick.&nbsp; It’s rich, chilled, December-dark—I’m eating deepest winter.</p><p class="centertalics"><em>gut ache ebbs—</em><br /><em>each spoon<br />
