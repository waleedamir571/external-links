He had no hairâ€”not on his head nor his eyebrows nor the backs of his hands when he handled the sulfuric acid and a rack of test tubes.&nbsp; He called the long-handled scoop a &ldquo;milk thief,&rdquo; which allowed him to reach deep into the stainless steel tanks to collect samples.&nbsp; He used a glass pipette to measure the perfect amount of milk and he held the tube at a precise angle when he added the acid.&nbsp; A gentle hand swirl and the milk solution turned dark brown.&nbsp; There was the distinct smell like charred caramel and a stern warning not to touch any part of the experiment.&nbsp;</p><p class="centertalics"><em>parts per million</em><br /><em>slipping onion grass&nbsp;</em><br /><em>to one cow in the herd</em></p></tr></table><p align='center'><img src="#
