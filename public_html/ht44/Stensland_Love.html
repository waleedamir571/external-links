Being on friendly terms with my neighbors, I know it doesn&rsquo;t belong to any of them.&nbsp; Not knowing what to do, I reach down to pet the cat.&nbsp; It licks my hand and headbutts my leg.&nbsp; In the cupboard I have a can of tuna, which I open and offer, but the cat ignores it and continues rubbing and licking me.</p><p class="justify">Where I move, it moves.&nbsp; I start rearranging my apartment in my mind, wondering where I could put a litter box.&nbsp; But then I catch myself: I&rsquo;m on the verge of becoming the guy who adopts a stray cat and thinks it&rsquo;s an answered prayer.&nbsp; I hear the cat meowing outside, where I tossed it, as I climb the stairs back to my apartment.</p><p class="centertalics"><em>she offers to pay</em><br /><em>half the check . . .</em><br /><em>not ready for love</em></p></tr></table><p align='center'><img src="../images_new/closure.gif" width="285" height="23" alt="end" /></td><td width="80" valign="top" bgcolor="#DDDFE4"><img src="../images_new/koi1_double_r.jpg" width="80"  height="1075" alt="koi" /><br /></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><map name="Links" id="Links"><area shape="rect" coords="97,205,245,227" href="https://haibuntoday.thehaikufoundation.org/htv3n1" alt="Current" /><area shape="rect" coords="251,206,460,228" href="https://haibuntoday.thehaikufoundation.org/htv3n1" alt="Contents" /><area shape="rect" coords="469,207,573,229" href="https://haibuntoday.thehaikufoundation.org/pages/about.html" alt="about" /><area shape="rect" coords="579,208,679,229" href="https://haibuntoday.thehaikufoundation.org/pages/archives.html" alt="archives" /><area shape="rect" coords="690,208,801,230" href="https://haibuntoday.thehaikufoundation.org/pages/resources.html" alt="resources" /><area shape="rect" coords="812,208,890,230" href="https://haibuntoday.thehaikufoundation.org/pages/search.html" alt="search" /><area shape="rect" coords="899,208,1039,230" href="https://haibuntoday.thehaikufoundation.org/pages/submissions.html" alt="submissions" /><area shape="rect" coords="183,76,275,124" href="index44.html" alt="current" /><area shape="rect" coords="278,76,364,123" href="https://haibuntoday.thehaikufoundation.org/pages/about.html" /><area shape="rect" coords="366,76,444,122" href="https://haibuntoday.thehaikufoundation.org/pages/archives.html" /><area shape="rect" coords="447,77,542,121" href="https://haibuntoday.thehaikufoundation.org/pages/resources.html" /><area shape="rect" coords="545,77,653,121" href="https://haibuntoday.thehaikufoundation.org/pages/submissions.html" /><area shape="rect" coords="656,76,730,122" href="https://haibuntoday.thehaikufoundation.org/pages/search.html" /></map></body></html>
