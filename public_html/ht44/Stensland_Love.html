Being on friendly terms with my neighbors, I know it doesn&rsquo;t belong to any of them.&nbsp; Not knowing what to do, I reach down to pet the cat.&nbsp; It licks my hand and headbutts my leg.&nbsp; In the cupboard I have a can of tuna, which I open and offer, but the cat ignores it and continues rubbing and licking me.</p><p class="justify">Where I move, it moves.&nbsp; I start rearranging my apartment in my mind, wondering where I could put a litter box.&nbsp; But then I catch myself: I&rsquo;m on the verge of becoming the guy who adopts a stray cat and thinks it&rsquo;s an answered prayer.&nbsp; I hear the cat meowing outside, where I tossed it, as I climb the stairs back to my apartment.</p><p class="centertalics"><em>she offers to pay</em><br /><em>half the check . . .</em><br /><em>not ready for love</em></p></tr></table><p align='center'><img src="#
