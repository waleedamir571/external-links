You could hike from Key West continuously to that point on established trails. The Appalachians, the oldest mountain chain, begin in the Deep South, get to this point, dip into the ocean, onto Newfoundland, another dip, touch down in the British Isles, dip again, and finally rise in Norway. We push up the inclines and avoid the muddy hollows. The overlooks are thick with fog and not another soul on the trail. We are drenched with sweat. A far cry from our hike here several years before in perfect summer weather with the trail’s end clustering with people. We weren’t expecting more than to reach trail’s end and turn around, the flora leached of color, the fauna probably keeping dry. I thought at first it was a warning but perhaps more a bit of a rebuke.</p><p class="centertalics"><em>a gull’s cry</em><br /><em>browsing on the point</em><br /><em>young black bear</em></p></tr></table><p align='center'><img src="#
