Head first, a gigantic cockroach, larger than a man, is very slowly dragged up the wall by hundreds of the ants. Dwarfed by the scale of its enormous corpse, their minute bodies are only a fuzzy fringe to its huge limbs.&nbsp; The tiny workers seem individually to have no united purpose, apparently pulling in every direction at once,<em>but still it moves</em>.</p><p class="justify">Far across the other side of the lobby a black woman is sitting on a bench reading.&nbsp; In front and to one side of her is a wheel chair containing her severely disabled charge, his head somehow too small for his obese body.&nbsp; He is nodding in time to the jerky movements of his left arm as he repeatedly lifts his crooked fingers to the top of the sloping tray in front of him and drags them down to the bottom.&nbsp;</p><p class="centertalics"><em>at</em><br /><em>the</em><br /><em>centre</em><br /><em>maggot</em><br /><em>sleeping</em><br /><em>bags</em><br /><em>hang</em><br /><em>in</em></p><p class="centertalics"><em>metamorphosis</em></p><p class="justify">&nbsp;</p></tr></table><p align='center'><img src="#
