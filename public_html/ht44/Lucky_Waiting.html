It&rsquo;s the last day I&rsquo;ll see my son before returning home to Ethiopia and leaving him to fend for himself at university. He&rsquo;s late for our appointment at the cafe. The mist hovers in the air. He&rsquo;s deaf to alarms, I remind myself. Maybe he got laid and thinks he&rsquo;s in love. That makes us all lose track of time. Maybe he went out drinking last night and is hung over. It&rsquo;s raining now. Last night was the last time I saw my son. Between the bus stop and the dorm, he could&rsquo;ve been jumped, beaten and robbed, his body tossed into the woods. The rain won&rsquo;t stop. I can&rsquo;t remember what he was wearing or if he had an umbrella.</p><p class="centertalics"><em>third coffee</em><br /><em>the battery in my phone</em><br /><em>is dead</em></p><P class="justify">I leave the cafe and wander around the square, grab a chicken tikka masala pasty at a local shop that claims all its pasties are smuggled from Cornwall, and then see my son exit a bookshop. He spots me and waves, and I watch him walk toward me. There&rsquo;s an unfamiliar look of concern in his eyes. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;ve you been?&rdquo; he demands, shaking his umbrella at me. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been waiting for hours.&rdquo;</p></tr></table><p align='center'><img src="#
