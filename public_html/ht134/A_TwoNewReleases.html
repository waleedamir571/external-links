 <p align="justify"> The Anthology is a collection of 121 haibun by 61 poets across the world with sumi-e artwork by Ron Moss. Editor Paresh Tiwari writes:</p>
 <blockquote>
  <p align="justify">With haibun’s relatively fluid nature in mind, this anthology sought to present writers of every ‘persuasion’ and every ‘school’. We received more than 500 submissions, and as we read through each piece, We were amazed at the quality of work, the range, scope, experimentation and the inherent beauty of each haibun. Some of these works are from seasoned poets, people we have looked up to for many years now, and many others from poets whose work we came across for the first time. This to us has been the real victory for this anthology — bringing the form to writers and poets who hadn’t yet dipped their toes in this old pond. And now we hope that this collection will reach a broad, eclectic readership.</p>

	 THJ is a new print journal dedicated to haibun. The second issue features   28 haibun from writers around the world. The majority of contributors hail from Ireland (where the journal is based) and the USA, with England, Wales, Canada, Portugal, New Zealand,  Australia, and Japan also represented. The issue offers a diverse array of voices, styles, and subject matter, from memories of family and notable locales to reflections on prison inmates (told through the persona of a &quot;lifer&quot;). It also includes the second installment (parts IV–VI) of Stallion's Crag, the late Ken Jones' classic 6,000-word haibun about roaming Plynlimon, &quot;the sacred mountain of Wales.&quot; Overall, a fine selection featuring some of the haibun community's best writers (including Haibun Today's own Terri French and Patricia Prime) and an important addition to the literature of the genre.
