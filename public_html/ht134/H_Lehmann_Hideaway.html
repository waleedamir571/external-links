The playground across the street from my mother’s apartment had four swings, a slide, and mulberry trees. Beyond the playground was the Pit, a large drainage ditch where my friend and I collected old bricks. Beyond the Pit were train tracks. Across the train tracks was an abandoned factory full of broken glass and old machinery. I wasn’t allowed to cross the train tracks, and the factory was definitely off-limits, but my dad and I went plenty of times. We would return from the factory with enormous rubber bands, as big as my dad, that were probably giant O-rings for some large apparatus that made whatever-it-was the factory used to make. We would slip the rubber bands over a mulberry tree branch and jump on them like bouncy swings. I told my mom the first time we went to the old factory. Upset as she was, I never told her again.
