Entanglement 


</strong>



</p><p align="justify">

I never knew why my grandparents divorced. It was a taboo topic the family never discussed. Ever since I was a kid, I’ve always wondered why Oma and Opa would be together at family gatherings and would seem to get along just fine but didn’t live together. 
</p><p align="justify">
Going through my grandmother’s old boxes in her attic after her death has become my responsibility. Her passing affects me all the more as I filter through photo albums and souvenirs. I pause with guilt as I open an old diary.
</p><p align="justify">
I begin to read. I’m captivated as I fall into its pages and become unaware of the time as the morning slips into afternoon and the afternoon into evening. Unexpectedly, I come across the reason for their divorce. I lay the diary down with the feelings of sadness and confusion rolled into one.
</p><p align="justify">
I’m suddenly aware of the shadows surrounding me. My eyes grow tired as I watch a spider build its web on the frame of my grandparents’ wedding picture.

sealed with kisses <br />
a betrayal addressed <br />
