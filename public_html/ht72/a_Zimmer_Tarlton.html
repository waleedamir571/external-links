On “Fortuna” by Charles Tarlton


</strong></p>

<p align="justify">

It is the poet’s function to see, remember, and recreate experience. However, art, like everything else, is under the jurisdiction of “Fortuna” being mostly outside the control of the artist. The title of Charles Tarlton’s tanka-prose, “Fortuna,” along with its two opening epigrams give us to understand the subject the poet means to investigate: the extent to which our lives are more often determined by “destiny” than will.  

<p align="justify">The beautiful first tanka embraces classic tanka imagery but robs it of the usual (English) sentimentality attached to it. Instead, it is employed to delineate the poet’s very real and daunting challenge:

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">new plum blossoms<br />
tempt the artist's<br />
brush, his poor palette<br />
pictures a memory<br />
under the cold snow

</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">The past makes a sudden demand on the present, a link in the chain of causation that will not be ignored. The use of enjambment between the second and third lines reveals how psychological forces beyond his control undermine the artist’s intent. He knows that to succumb to temptation will likely result in a hackneyed poem marked by inauthenticity. The integrity of his art will not permit him to overlook the hidden complexity that makes the very appearance of blossoms a necessity. 

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">art reveals<br />
only what it means<br />
to conceal <br />
weight, boulders, and iron<br />
 girders tipping the scales

</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">From its lyrical opening and subtle rhyme, the tanka surprises with its turn towards a solely image-driven conclusion:

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">weight, boulders, and iron<br />
girders tipping the scales

</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">Tasked with addressing reality and giving it imaginative coherence, the poet’s seeking of connections and associations results in a sense of unity. Such subjective unity often feels transcendent though comprised of that which really appears and can be known: <em>girders tipping the scales</em>. 

<p align="justify">This is a particularly interesting tanka for its caesura rendering malleable the density and heft of its imagery. Substance is revealed as more fragile than function would suggest. Again, we have the art of seeing “deep down things.”<sup>i</sup> 

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">stones then being brought<br />
 
are wedged<br />
under the house<br />

some lean into the work<br />
some fly away

</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p align="justify">The aesthetic pleasures of things are not something super-added but inherent in the materials of which they are comprised. There is something seemingly haphazard in the process, something achieved by trial and error even if ultimately inevitable. “Except the LORD build the house, they labour in vain that build it.”<sup>ii</sup>

<p align="justify">This tanka asks us to look, to become aware of intrinsic value, of the truly weight-bearing. It is all so blindingly obvious and close: “No ideas but in things.”iii  Satisfaction rises from a sense of recognition that that feels like revelation.

<p align="justify">The prose and tanka that follow clarify any confusion. Not everything works out to the “good” as Pauline doctrine would have it. Morality has no purchase here. We are actors unable to predict endings and outcomes, the script seemingly written as we proceed “ad lib.” To track all the variables is not an experience available to us. “<em>The moment comes filled with possibilities—from here to just about anywhere.</em>” The randomness of what Epicurus called “swerve” can be neither predicted nor anticipated
<p>“It is true that the son of a lion roars like as a lion.”<sup>iv</sup> Tokimune comes to understand his victories as a combination of personal strength and the vagaries of circumstance. “<em>The road ahead forks infinitely, digression on digression, like the veins in my forearm or rain down a windowpane.</em>” In his case things turn out advantageously due to a combination of strategy and the weather!</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">twice the enemy<br />
routed by <em>kamikaze</em><br />
sad drowned Armadas<br />
Tokimune<br />
whistled at his luck

</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">The next tanka suggests another possibility, one born of misplaced confidence in Fate conferring preferential advantage. On the heels of triumph, our horseman in his unchecked exhilaration, blinds himself to the signs that Fortuna has just changed her mind regarding him:

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">and rode up on a pale horse<br />
too broad a grin<br />
he couldn't see<br />
backwards or exactly where<br />
 
the road turned

</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">In the final phase of Tarlton’s meditation, we encounter the poet’s subtle avoidance in drawing definitive conclusions. He makes no claim save to say: this is how things appear, not as conventional wisdom or religious faith would have them, but simply as they do.
<p align="justify">The tanka-prose closes with two apposite poems. The first springs from a visceral hope and fear in the face of uncertainty. Its bald simplicity intensifies our sense of danger and risk, its “<em>pause</em>” perhaps more taxing than any possible outcome.
<p align="justify">In response to his assistant’s quoting of a reassuring scripture involving ultimate justice, the wizard adds a coterie of contradictory characters and vices also worthy of  blessing:  

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">But the mighty are as vulnerable," the wizard added. "We never say blessed are the powerful, the pernicious, and the warlike, but not because they don't need it.” 
</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">in the moment<br />
of action<br />
the heart pauses<br />
 
awaiting<br />
 
unknown outcomes

</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">The last tanka depicts the play of the building blocks of existence itself. It reads as a subtle exhortation to detachment, the only honest strategy left us. Such detachment frees from the pride of an exaggerated sense of personal agency though not (as Schopenhauer argued) from personal responsibility or its consequences. 

<p align="justify">The poem’s simple metric and on-rhyme combine to present us with a kind of charm, a mnemonic recalling Fortuna’s double-edged sword of Fate and Myopia. It is by this sword that she both knights and has her way with us. Like all witchcraft, the hour to come will generally undo the spell’s illusory power, but until that hour, we take our comfort (and pleasure) where we can.

<p align="justify" class="font12"><strong>Author’s Note:</strong> <em>Kamikaze</em> means "divine wind" in Japanese and was used, of course, in connection with Japanese suicide bomber pilots in WWII. A much earlier use referred to the typhoons in 1274 and 1281 that turned back invading Mongolian ships during the reign of Hōjō Tokimune (1268-1284).
