<p align="justify"><em><strong> 1. The Jeffersonian Swivel</strong></em>
<p align="justify">It’s walled in glass, neither square nor rectangular—diamond-shaped, a single room, no door.  Wainscoted in the rich, lustrous hardwood of a <em>palacio</em>, inside it stands a man on a wooden stepladder hammering a last piece of crown molding into place. Vaulted by an intense cerulean sky, winds erase and reshape the fine white sands of dunes beneath it.

<p align="justify">And then the room begins to swivel slowly, hovering above the sand without accelerating.

<p align="justify">I turn toward the placid ocean, its enormous magnet pulling at the iron slivers in my heart. When I look back at the room, the swiveling has stopped . . . and the hammering . . . the ladder is gone; the glass room’s empty except for the man and a tripod on which an old surveyor’s transit sits.

<p align="justify">He bends over to look through its long brass telescope. Turning its knob slowly, he focuses, smiles—the instrument beams its warmth. He trains it in my direction then stands up, open-mouthed on the verge of speaking:

<p align="justify"><img src="t_LeBel_image1.jpg" width="222" height="279" alt="image" align="right" hspace="10" />I say, “What is it, Father? What do you see?”

<p align="justify">Without answering he turns and faces the horizon, squinting as I do against the glare. The room begins to spin around him again, as noiselessly as Andromeda wheels about her dark, eternal spindle . . .

<p align="justify">till twilight dissolves his outline . . .
<br />
then his body . . . then the room . . .

<p align="justify">and I wake.

<p align="left">Arrows, yes,
<br />
we have arrows
<br />
but no bow
<br />
so we crouch on the shore together
<br />
preening our missiles’ feathers<br />

<p align="Center" class="font12">“<em>Hardship he sent to you, and you must bear it</em>.”<br />
<br />

				—Homer, <em>The Odyssey, Book VI</em>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">Deed me a river<br />
& a Warmblood to cross it—<br />
on that farther shore, O king,<br />
dub me Getae for a day unending <br />
with the samaras of your sword
	
</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">Along a path above the river, the long maple branch is clad with a velvety glove of moss; it grows low and parallel to the ground, so long and spindly that the slightest breeze makes it dance and quiver. Like the style of bonsai in which the artist half-buries a young branchlet from which a row of “trees” will sprout, this limb, too, bears several offspring pushing skywards, “from one the many.”
<p align="justify"><img src="t_LeBel_image2.jpg" width="199" height="261" alt="image" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="10" />Curious as to why it had taken this “path of least resistance,” I trace its origin back to the half-sunken crown of its modest beginning to find that it is not a limb at all but the bole itself. A wedge of stone the size of an axe-head had barred its way and so the tree had simply swerved around it. Once redirected, it stayed low to the ground, thriving beneath a crack of sunlight leaking down through the oaken canopy sprinkling all its “saplings” with leaves. Still grieving for my father, the image is not wasted, for even a tree does not always do what is expected but what it must.
