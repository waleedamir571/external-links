There are no clouds on the wide horizon. Then a stray balloon, probably lost by a toddler who is still crying, comes into view. From nowhere a gull appears and fetches the balloon. The wind gets stronger and and both gull and balloon are blown away. I never find out the end of the story.<p align="center"><em>ever writing<br />

As I ponder this, a second balloon appears. Could it be the same one? But the wide horizon is different. The wind has brought many clouds with it. The balloon quickly vanishes into the clouds. I look to my side, and my shadow's gone too. Could that have been the toddler?</p></tr></table><p align='center'><img src="#
