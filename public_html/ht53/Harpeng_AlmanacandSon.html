I have a photograph of 1918.<p align="justify"> 	
The history of the world is closed upon the small table in the photographer's studio. It is a story of closed doors and open windows, thatched and slate roofs, of stew with potatoes and cabbages, of things said while others slept or were day-dreaming. A few words which someone remembered or pretended to remember. They dipped a pen in the ink pot and began to scratch at the page.<p align="center"><em>how to look out<br />
of a photo?—as if you were<br />
not dead<br />
only far away&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;right<br />
in front of your eyes</em><p align="justify">	
A young man in lumpy uniform stands with one hand resting on the back of a chair on which his mother sits. He wears his Feldmutze tugged lower over his brow to the left. The fly of his tunic covers ersatz buttons of wood or bakelite. The thumb of his left hand hooks his belt near the buckle; a trench dagger hangs from his belt; he wears boots for walking among the dead.<p align="center"><em>unlit cigarette<br />
between two fingers<br />
rolled just before<br />
the camera flash<br />
now lit and never lit</em><p align="justify">	
With one of her children standing beside her, even her profound tiredness has a few childishly simple things to say. In tired and sturdy clothes the old lady is an almanac of things out of date—birthdays of the dead, phases of the moon, a record of past eclipses. The kicks and turns of her children before they were born, they still eddy in her.<p align="center"><em>her hand is closed<br />
like she is holding on to<br />
 
something small as hope<br />
with an arthritic grip<br />
she holds her children by name</em></p></tr></table><p align='center'><img src="../images_new/closure.gif" width="285" height="23" alt="end" /></td><td width="80" valign="top" bgcolor="#DDDFE4"><img src="../images_new/koi1_double_r.jpg" width="80"  height="1075" alt="koi" /><br /></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><map name="Links" id="Links"><area shape="rect" coords="97,205,245,227" href="https://haibuntoday.thehaikufoundation.org/htv3n1" alt="Current" /><area shape="rect" coords="251,206,460,228" href="https://haibuntoday.thehaikufoundation.org/htv3n1" alt="Contents" /><area shape="rect" coords="469,207,573,229" href="https://haibuntoday.thehaikufoundation.org/pages/about.html" alt="about" /><area shape="rect" coords="579,208,679,229" href="https://haibuntoday.thehaikufoundation.org/pages/archives.html" alt="archives" /><area shape="rect" coords="690,208,801,230" href="https://haibuntoday.thehaikufoundation.org/pages/resources.html" alt="resources" /><area shape="rect" coords="812,208,890,230" href="https://haibuntoday.thehaikufoundation.org/pages/search.html" alt="search" /><area shape="rect" coords="899,208,1039,230" href="https://haibuntoday.thehaikufoundation.org/pages/submissions.html" alt="submissions" /><area shape="rect" coords="183,76,275,124" href="https://haibuntoday.thehaikufoundation.org/ht53/index53.html" alt="current" /><area shape="rect" coords="278,76,364,123" href="https://haibuntoday.thehaikufoundation.org/pages/about.html" /><area shape="rect" coords="366,76,444,122" href="https://haibuntoday.thehaikufoundation.org/pages/archives.html" /><area shape="rect" coords="447,77,542,121" href="https://haibuntoday.thehaikufoundation.org/pages/resources.html" /><area shape="rect" coords="545,77,653,121" href="https://haibuntoday.thehaikufoundation.org/pages/submissions.html" /><area shape="rect" coords="656,76,730,122" href="https://haibuntoday.thehaikufoundation.org/pages/search.html" /></map></body></html>
