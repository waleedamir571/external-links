It is Sunday, five AM. He says I don't want to kill you. The avenue is dark; orange light from the sun oozes between apartment buildings. I struggle to find my $10 for the van, $5 for food. Coins must fall. I do not hear them fall. I hear nothing but his voice.<em>Your wedding ring, your watch</em>. My ring sticks and I assure him:<em>It will come</em>. He points to a drive that leads under the nearby museum stairs.<em>Go down there.</em> Obediently, I start down the driveway as from a far place that used to be me I hear myself weep:<em>Now I can't see my husband</em>.  I look back to see the man watching  me, and suddenly I realize that he is going to shoot.<p align="center"><em>New York City<br />
