The moment comes filled with possibilities—from here to just about anywhere.  It all depends.  Before this or that dream can come true, the sky opens—love, disease, war, winning raffle tickets, random possibility directs the world's forces.

A much earlier use referred to the typhoons in 1274 and 1281 that turned back invading Mongolian ships during the reign of<em>Hōjō Tokimune</em> (1268-1284).</tr></table><p align='center'></td><td width="80" valign="top" bgcolor="#
