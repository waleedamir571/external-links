'Old Rocker' is an exquisitely crafted haibun: the prose, the haiku and the title all resonate with each other to create something more than their individual parts. Remove one of those elements and the haibun's overall effect is diminished.<p align="justify">
The fragmented syntax of the prose effectively mirrors thought process while the lyricism of the haiku contrasts the prose syntactically and complements it linguistically. The haiku link and shift beautifully to and from the prose and the overall theme of ageing is reinforced by both haiku, explicitly in the first and implicitly in the second, without repetition. The title plays with the reader on a number of levels: it highlights the theme of ageing, references a phrase in the prose (<em>rocking & rolling</em>) to further knit those two elements together, and also suggests the image of an old rocking chair, a symbol of both old age and comfort.<p align="justify">  
And I am comforted by this haibun, both as writer and reader.<p align="justify">  
I admire the precise concrete imagery that is emotionally convincing and the reciprocation of form and content evident in the choice of syntax. I also admire the construction: the haiku feel consciously placed and contribute to the overall dramatic development. The reader shifts between stream of consciousness and more focused reflection as the narrator shifts between movement and stasis, from walking to the bathroom for the necessary pause, then back to bed and a second moment of reflection in the closing haiku. It would not be an exaggeration to say I am in awe of the final haiku. These 10 ordinary words encapsulate the haibun's theme and extend it too, but also, for me, invoke Basho's crow, although here the settling is replaced with an element of resistance. In that one word<em>beat</em>, we can read struggle, measuring time, and perhaps even winning some ground.<p align="justify">  
I read the haibun again, and again. I find myself 'rocked' by the rhythms and language, its pathos and bathos; its insights that expose and embrace truth.<br /><br /><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Ken Jones</strong><br />

Nagata Koi (1900-1997): outstanding Zen haiku poet of old age. Translation by Margaret Mitsutani and Naruto Nana.</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><br /><br /><p align="justify"><strong>Jeffrey Woodward writes on "Making it to Twenty-ten":</strong><p align="justify">
Two elderly couples of long acquaintance are reunited. It is unclear if they meet frequently or if this evening marks some special occasion, perhaps a celebration of the circumstance signalled by the title, of the "four of us" having "made it to the here and now" of another decade with the "1930s not quite lost in history."<p align="justify">
While the general scene is one of a convivial gathering of dear friends, a palpable tension underlies each gesture and remark. What at first seems casual is revealed as calculated. The polished conversation of the couples is transparent and no disguise for the rivalry that has long animated their friendship. This contest revolves about the male narrator and the other man's wife, about their "limited liability" flirtation that is tacitly acknowledged by all parties. Is it significant that this other woman describes herself as a "pagan Christian" and later introduces the topic of Mary Magdalene—not with any abiding devotional interest, it would seem, but simply for the slight provocation of her question, "Whore or virgin?"<p align="justify">
The erotic undercurrent of this haibun is largely cerebral. The reader may readily surmise as much from the epigraph, a haiku by Nagata Koi, whose "aged butterfly" hints at the diminished powers—sexual and otherwise—of the narrator and his companions. Full confirmation of this is offered at the haibun's conclusion; the lively party of four have together reached the "bottom of the glass" of their Leffe Abbey ale, the playful French recording of Georges Brassens has concluded, and their collective energy has shifted to singing along with a Maldwyn Pope rendition of the hymn "Bread of Heaven":<blockquote>
	Guide me, O thou Great Jehovah,<br />
	Pilgrim through this barren land . . .</blockquote>
What a sober turn of events! But their short reunion, too, has come to an end and the bleak night beckons where our aging narrator, by porch light, receives<blockquote>
	Her good night hug<br />
	no longer<br />
	no closer<br />
	than it needs to be</blockquote><hr align="left" width="200" noshade="noshade" />
