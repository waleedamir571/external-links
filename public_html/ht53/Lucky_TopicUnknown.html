That was the year I first began publishing haibun, and at the time I was a neophyte tanka writer. I wasn't skeptical so much as insecure. I was still fumbling with the relationship between prose and haiku. There seemed to be a distinction being made between haibun and tanka prose, but I was hazy on the details. I read a lot and tried to keep my mouth shut.<br /></p><p align="justify">The first tanka prose piece I wrote, &ldquo;Strategies,&rdquo; and one that was eventually published in<em>Modern English Tanka</em> and later included in<em>The Tanka Prose Anthology</em>, was entirely fictional. It grew out of a discussion my wife and I had about what to eat for dinner: a variation on<em>chilequiles</em>made from odds and ends in the fridge. I wrote it under pressure of a sorts. Others on the blog were posting with regularity, and I thought I'd better jump into the fray or quietly bow out. So, I made it up. Pure fiction. And at the time this seemed something that distinguished tanka prose from haibun, which I held to some factual accountability, some autobiographical anchoring. Of course, like in confessional poetry, facts can get in the way of the truth the poet is digging for. The point is, this freedom to make things up, to go fictional, in tanka prose, was liberating, even though it was the result of much ignorance.<p align="justify">
I had luck with &ldquo;Strategies,&rdquo; a kind of beginner's luck. I did work on it, revised and revised again, but there was no compelling reason to write it. It began with an image of an almost empty refrigerator and a snippet of conversation with my wife. There's nothing wrong with this; much of the poetry I write begins with an image or a sound, a phrase. But haibun and tanka prose are something other than poetry, even something other than prose poetry. What that is still vexes me at times. When I look at the tanka prose and haibun I've written, it's clear to me that the ones that have some merit are the ones that needed to be written. I'm not sure what that need is and what is satisfied by the writing, but certain incidents, images, turns of phrase, surfacing memories and dreams have me scribbling away on paper or pecking at a computer. Usually what follows is days or weeks or months of revising; sometimes what I've written sits and molds a bit. Some of what I've written never gets submitted. A fair bit gets rejected. I tend to rewrite every rejected piece and submit it elsewhere . . . . Sometimes nothing I do can make a piece publishable.<p align="justify">
And that brings me to the tanka prose piece below, &ldquo;Topic Unknown, Amherst, Summer 2008,&rdquo; which was published the same year as &ldquo;Strategies.&rdquo; What I'm about to say is what no writing instructor ever wants to hear: It's more or less a first draft and I did it in about an hour. The only revision was to remove the punctuation from the prose and, at the suggestion of Woodward, who was editing a special tanka prose edition of<em> Santa Fe Poetry Broadsheet</em>, change one verb tense. However, I walked and drove around Amherst for three or four days shaping the piece in my head, after writing the opening tanka the day of the bar mitzvah.<p align="justify">
And that's another thing: This is a true story. Of all the tanka prose pieces I've written, this is the one closest to the facts and nothing but the facts. The only thing missing is my wife, who was with my son and me the entire time—at the B&amp;B, at the bar mitzvah, at Emily Dickinson's house. I would have no difficulty using the tanka prose piece as notes for a creative nonfiction essay. But I don't think that would be as interesting, which is one of the reasons I took the punctuation out of the prose. In fact, I wanted to push the prose toward a prose poem, and in my mind it would stand as such if I removed the enveloping tanka. I like it better as a tanka prose piece.<p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><strong>Topic Unknown, Amherst, Summer 2008</strong></p><p>bar mitzvah<br />
