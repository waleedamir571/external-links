In the desert<br />
I saw a creature, naked, bestial,<br />
Who, squatting upon the ground,<br />
Held his heart in his hands,<br />
And ate of it.<br />
I said: "Is it good, friend?"<br />
"It is bitter - bitter," he answered;<br />
"But I like it<br />
Because it is bitter,<br />
And because it is my heart."<br /><br />

Moving away from the alley where the fight had been, he could taste blood; it tasted good, a little blood.  At first, he was angry.  They had caught him by surprise and there had been three of them.  He'd teach them a lesson, though, work out a little scheme for revenge; catch them all—one at a time.  So, why did he have to fight off this sense of guilt? What did he have to be guilty about?<p align="center"><em>under my breath<br />

A nasty little road somewhere; you're expecting Beckett's "A tree."  As we travel farther away from the city, through tiny garden-farms, past the end of the bus route, we see fewer and fewer people.  Here, a mailbox on a post has been knocked over; there, a bicycle upended in a ditch.  Has there been a war? You wonder.  An epidemic?  Are you approaching the end of the world?  Is it a dream?<p align="center"><em>my arms in torn<br />

The old medical handbook we found on my father's bedside table contained a caricature of the gout.  A swollen human foot rests on a pillow, and a purple monster has fastened himself to it—a devil, a rat, or a vampire imp with fangs, fiery nostrils, and huge sharp claws digging into that tender foot.  Did my father wake to its snarling?<p align="center"><em>as it unfolds<br />

Debris was thick right up to their fenced property line.  Greasy underfed dogs barked at the end of long chains.  At the very center of the lot sat an old trailer.  It needed paint and a new window.  A television aerial was fastened near the top of a pine tree.  An elderly couple lived there.  We seldom saw them; I don't think they were well.<p align="center"><em>smart weed<br />
