Quite by accident (who knows where they come from) a collage jumps up out of a pile of torn papers. But something is missing—ah, yes: eyes. Add them and it becomes a face. But whose? Why, Lady Ise's, of course, it's axiomatic. First, make lips: they're easy—two arcs of the scissors and<em>voilà</em>, Beaujolais red and kissable.<p align="justify">
I cut the eyes freehand with a razor knife: courtly, furtive, smoke grey.  Once laid down on the image, the fun begins: placed too high and she forfeits beauty. Crowd them too closely and nobility evaporates, not to mention her fierce intelligence. Twenty different placements give you twenty different temperaments. I let the whole thing gel awhile under a pane of glass . . . but she keeps insisting that I finish her.<em><img src="LeBel_image2.jpg" alt="image" width="254" height="355" hspace="10" vspace="30" align="right" /></em><p align="center"><em>Lovers you didn't want,<br />
children you didn't plan for,<br />
sad, sad Lady Ise,<br />
look up from the centuries:</em><br />
nothing's changed—<p align="justify">The eyes are finished, angled only slightly, elegant, a bit sad, though still defiant. Now she wants hair! Brushed or pasted, darling, up in a bun or waterfalling those thin and weary shoulders?<p align="justify">
But I'm not going to give you hair because nearly everyone will have already imagined it long and shiny and crow's wing black . . . and also, Milady, because the mask of your poetry is what you preferred we see.<p align="center"><em>For the Sixth Month<br />
it seems,  my grief<br />
only accumulates—<br />
of what use cleansing<br />
stains that never fade?</em><br /><br />
