We are riding in the back seat of a broken down Ford Falcon in Belize City with two men whom we have never met; one has long dreadlocks and the other a nervous stammer. Twenty bucks is all it costs to have them taxi us around the city for an hour. Dreadlocks drives and the stammerer is our guide.<p align="center"><em>schoolyard<br />

We pass semi-dilapidated structures which have not been rebuilt since Hurricane Hattie nearly destroyed the city in 1961. The two young men argue over dates and facts, peppering rasta-flavored English with their native Kriol. "Cheese 'n Rice! Dat da lone rass!" says the driver to his buddy, who sighs and gazes out the passenger's side window.<p align="center"><em>a virgin mary<br />

As we drive past the cemetery dreadlocks tells us it is full of their young people, victims of gang violence and drug wars.<p align="center"><em>Lord's Ridge<br />

We stop for beers and things loosen up. Their names are Earl and Edwin and they've been friends since childhood. Earl says he has a computer and a girlfriend in New York City. Edwin has four children. He doesn't mention a wife. They drive us back to our port where lines of flip-flopped tourists wait to reboard. My husband shakes their hands and Edwin stammers his thanks.<p align="center"><em>poolside<br />
