I expect to see my father emerge from the cottage, or from the shed, or from the woods with a basket of chanterelles. Instead, I am struck by the silence. His bench beside the pond is empty now.  I feed the fish and watch their silver green backs slide along the surface before they disappear in the dark waters.<p align="justify">Inside the cottage the air is cold and still. Bluebottles, stunned by the cold, walk aimlessly along the window ledges. An empty plate and cup rest on the table, as if waiting for his return, or a visitor.  I read his last journal entry.  His shaky handwriting describes the day the deer and fawn ate from his apple tree.<p align="center"><em>in the garden,<br />
