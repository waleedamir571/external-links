The sky has darkened, clouds lowering over the Sierras.  It's too early to cook, the sun still high, westering.  You say, lets look for the road to the Baxter Pass trailhead.  After we set up the stove and utility box, stuff our ten bucks into the auto-pay envelope and that into the pipe at the campground gate, we motor up a rotten dirt road and decide this can't be right.  Sagebrush scratches the sides of our SUV.  A covey of quail flushes and scatters in the dust.  We find a place to turn around and crumble south to Aberdeen, look for the little restaurant we remember. It's closed, open only for lunch.  We turn back up the highway, and here is the road we sought. It's a good one, paved, running east down to the Owens River, where Barn swallows seine the air above the bridge; and then west, straight toward an alluvial fan below the pass.  How could we have missed it?<p align="center"><em>golden flowers<br />

Beans, steak and wheat bread are slated for dinner.  Locust trees in bloom leave their petals across the table.  The little creek foams around the cottonwoods.  You crack open a beer.  The storm passes over us without event, south and east of here.</tr></table><p align='center'><img src="#
