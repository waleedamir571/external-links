Making Waves</strong></p><table width="70%" border="0" align="center"><tr><td height="216" valign="top"><p align="center"><em>we stand on the cliff<br />
the breeze fresh<br />
the sky soft<br />
a grey mist below us<br />
and muffled waves</em><p align="center"><em>the bay's near-crescent<br />
forms a threshold<br />
for our standing figures<br />
for what is moving<br />
and for what is still</em><p align="center"><em>now the seascape<br />
from rocks to islands shifts<br />
and there's a sea-change<br />
disturbing the gannets<br />
on their stacked pillars</em><p align="center"><em>a skirt of sea<br />
fills with the moans<br />
of desolate birds<br />
lifting low over<br />
half-lit water</em><p align="center"><em>last night's storm<br />
that tore across the Tasman<br />
is now exhausted,<br />
the wan smile of the sun<br />
lighting the sand</em><p align="justify">
Cumulus clouds mass in the sky, then move on, leaving the ocean to the bright summer light.  See how the waves rub against the rocks.  Look!  A blow-hole formed over centuries.   There's a scarlet pohutukawa gripping the cliff face.  A leaf drifts into my hand, its ribs lonely and separate.  I want you to see too the bluff where we walked years ago mimicking the gannets' cries.  See how unstable the cliff is nowâ€”all that is lively slipping away.<p align="justify">
The sea rolling in reminds me there are distant lands.  And everywhere there is motion, loneliness, the ocean's cold grind.  It is there in the cliff hollows, the rock formation, and the windswept beach.  And it is here on the steep track winding its way up from the sand.</tr></table><p align='center'><img src="#
