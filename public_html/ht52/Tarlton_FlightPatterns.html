In love enough with himself to fit in anywhere; after a long day sweating in the cornfield, he settles comfortably on the pickup tailgate and talks bushel price with the workers over a couple of beers.  Later on, he signs the final papers on his new Porsche, grinning like a kid.  He is flying as he turns onto the freeway.<p align="center"><em>the sun's last<br />

The great Leader's drama—forced to abdicate and flee, finish his days in a foreigner's house, in someone else's shoes.  He cannot imagine it.  He who has lived at such heights, how the mundane weighs down his wings, the air too thick to breathe.<p align="center"><em>Hokusai's famous woodcut<br />
