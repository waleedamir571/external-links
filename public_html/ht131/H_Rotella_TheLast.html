The Last Supper
</strong>

</p><p align="justify">



Having lived in Italy three years, we're two heartbroken expatriates
looking for comfort with nowhere to go but back to the States.
</p><p align="justify">
We make one last trip to our favorite hotel restaurant, where we had
dined dozens of times. Our favorite dish – panzarotti (broken
stomachs) of ravioli oozes with mozzarella smothered in a delicate
cream tomato sauce. But this evening my meal is a turnoff. A dead fly
in the salad is drenched in vinagrette. And the main course contains
the wing of an unidentified insect.
</p><p align="justify">
I call the waiter over, point first to the salad, then the pasta. He
whisks away our plates.
Within seconds the owner, with whom we’ve exchanged pleasantries in
the past, transforms into a raging rhinoceros. He charges toward us
while pushing a cart that contains the two courses. The disgusting
elements, of course, have been removed. He glares at my husband.
"Your wife has good eyes, but mine are much better. I don’t serve
dirty food in my restaurant."
</p><p align="justify">
"But it was there," I protest.
</p>
<p align="justify">
Instead of an apology, he proclaims, "Here in Italy, <em>Il padrone sempre
ha ragione</em>.&quot; I tell him in America it's the customer who’s always
right. </p><p align="center">

stains the snow
</p><p align="justify">
As we walk toward our car, the full moon rests on the lake where we
had picnicked so often. Il padrone appears at the door. The red dot of
his cigarette burns a hole into the night. He jots down our license
plate number while he wishes us a good night’s sleep, for tomorrow we
will be behind bars.  He assures us he knows every cop and judge in
this tiny town.
</p><p align="justify">
Our laughter subsides upon phoning our friend, Signorina LaPorta, who
has lived in this village her whole life. She tells us he is indeed
well connected, that we could be detained from leaving Italy. But, she
assures us she will take care of the matter. As Secretary of the
Rotary Club, she will assure him that we are an honorable couple. If
 he does not rescind his threat, she will guarantee the Rotary Club
never holds another affair at his hotel.
</p><p align="justify">
"No problem, Signorina, I will send the lovely couple champagne and
roses in the morning."
