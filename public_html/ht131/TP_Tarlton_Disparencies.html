	. . . poetry and painting, and the arts in general, are, in their measure, a compensation for what has been lost.<br />
         —Wallace Stevens, <em>The Relations between Poetry and Painting </em></p><p align="justify">
Like two of Picasso's "bridesmaids" (or, as some would have it, "prostitutes") in <em>Les Demoiselles</em>, M. Villon’s figures hide here under masks. Of course, it might be only a convention of the period or style, or it might have meant to suggest the mystery of the masquerade ball or the moral anonymity of <em>Mardi Gras</em>. Are these masks of shame, perhaps? They could be, if Villon’s title was a valid one and not just something he (or someone else) later added on. Taking the title seriously makes us look for telltale signs, <em>Phèdre’s</em> lasciviousness or <em>Hippolyte's</em> fixation: are there really two human figures in the picture at all, and if so, are their postures sexual ones, are they partially naked? </p><p align="center">
sharpest choreography<br />
of strange parts, from things unknown<br />
we headlong infer<br />
to be an arm, hair, an eye <br />
<em>décolletage's</em> air of lust </p><p align="center">
the title, was it<br />
merely added on? Could be<br />
only suggestive<br />
of heads and hair and of dead eyes<br />
caught on a whirling T-square

</p><p align="center">
why might a fragment<br />
of knickers or a harlequin <br />
thigh, without a hand<br />
or recognizable foot<br />
suffice for this narrative?

</p><p align="justify">
Here there are the intersections of so many geometric plane surfaces, cast in their aborted triangles, truncated trapezoids, parallels abruptly broken, crossed, intersected. And overlaid, filling in the resulting shapes with colors, more than a hint of human figures, but then, almost immediately, not that either. Oh, the salacious mind wants to discern flesh, bared bosoms and naked torsos, but below that, all is a tumult of uncertainty as colored arabesques collide in a descent to pure abstraction at the floor. 

</p><p align="center">
how Love's lightwave looks<br />
just when it has been fractured<br />
the sites of passion<br />
disparate in percipience<br />
scattering the <em>mis-en-scène </em></p><p align="center">
auspicious <em>loci</em><br />
<em>d'amour</em>, a splintering window<br />
glass to cleaving lovers<br />
refracting weirdly in ice<br />
hurriedly disassembled

</p><p align="center">
these awkward planes toss<br />
up to me their twisted frames<br />
and the modest eye<br />
now only squints and looks away<br />
unable to make them whole

</p><p align="justify">
Unless . . . that's his blue arm and hand at her genitals there, and her legs parting in that wide V-shape of double parallel lines; unless her right arm (turning red, to rose, to black) gently caresses his hair and he's staring wide-eyed into her plunging neckline. Rounded and bulging forms remain to the fussy eye as yet inconclusive. Strictly phallic images are too easy, especially with curved and snaky lines proliferating so. Are they right before coitus or just after?

</p><p align="center">
lovers suspended<br />
in cool midair, side by side<br />
is he asking her<br />
if she fears his father's return<br />
or what he's likely to do?

</p><p align="center">
she tenderly strokes<br />
his callow feverish brow<br />
the shifting colors<br />
suggest a dream or perhaps<br />
untamed hallucinations

</p><p align="center">
I do not know which<br />
to prefer, a mere study<br />
in forms, or a wild<br />
narrative of smut and sex<br />
hiding in mutinous light
