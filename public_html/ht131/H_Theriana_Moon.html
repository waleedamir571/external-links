Today, I found an old photograph of my mother in the attic. I couldn't get my eyes off of this beautiful young woman. It feels strange that I don't really know her. After years fighting cancer, she passed away when I was only 5 years old .

</p>
<p align="justify">
People who knew her say the same thing about her â€“ she was a sweet, beautiful woman, a Belle of our small town. My sister May told me that while undergoing chemotherapy, my mother always put on her best dress and sometimes even wore high heels. She didn't want others to know about her illness or worry about her.

</p>
<p align="justify">
Now, while staring at her photograph, I imagine what it might be like to have her in my life. I see us sitting together on the porch, enjoying the glow of the moon hiding behind clouds. She becomes an enchantress, blowing up into the sky toward the clouds. Magic! The moon reveals itself. 

</p>
<p align="justify">
When clouds cover the moon again, she says, "Sometimes it's nice to rest behind the shadows," sighs, and holds me tight.

in me<br />
the darkside of the moon
