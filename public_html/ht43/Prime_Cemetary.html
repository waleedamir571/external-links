of an elm</em></p><p class="justify">The cemetery has an air of abandonment. The iron gate creaks on rusted hinges.&nbsp; There are no fresh flowers, no birds in the scanty trees.&nbsp; An obelisk, erected to the miners contains the names of the dead: aged from 11 to the early 40s, boys and men, many of them from the same family.&nbsp; We walk silently among the gravestones.&nbsp; One is of a family of seven children who died on the same day—no reason given—but the mother had another child the following year.&nbsp; There are memorials to two little girls burned to death in a house fire, to landslide victims, to a mass drowning.</p><p class="centertalics"><em>a waterfall of light</em><br /><em>runs down the obelisk</em><br /><em>ghostly voices</em><br /><em>unfold from the rank grass<br />
do they still live?</em></p><p class="justify">In strong, cold sunlight we leave, reliving the sight of the monument, wondering what the connection between these victims and ourselves might be about, hearing the tap-tap of our feet between each gravelled step.</p><p class="centertalics"><em>twists of fate—</em><br /><em>a conversation</em><br /><em>comes to life</em><br /><em>down the dark valley</em><br /><em>towards the sunset</em></p></tr></table><p align='center'><img src="#
