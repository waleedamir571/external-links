An Interview with Ruth Holzer</strong></p><table width="94%" border="0" align="center"><tr><td valign="top" class="justify"><p class="justify"><strong>Ruth Holzer lives in Virginia and works as a freelance translator.&nbsp;&nbsp; Her haibun have been published in<em>Haibun Today,</em><em>South by Southeast, bottle rockets, Modern Haiku, Lynx, The Nor’easter, Contemporary Haibun Online,</em>and<em>Modern Haibun</em><em>and</em><em>Tanka Prose.&nbsp;</em>Her poems have appeared in journals in the U.S.A., U.K., Canada and Australia.&nbsp; She is the author of<em>The First</em><em>Hundred Years</em> (Finishing Line Press, 2004),<em>The Solitude of Cities</em> (Finishing Line Press, 2006) and a haiku collection<em>Silk Flower</em> (ed. v. tripi, Pinch Book Series No. 7. Swamp Press: 2005).</strong><p><strong>PP:</strong>&nbsp; To begin with, I’m interested in your approach to the various genres in which you write: poems, haibun, tanka, haiku, etc.&nbsp; Is your approach to composition spontaneous or are you more interested in applying technique to material that you’ve previously written or that come from other sources?</p><p><strong>RH:&nbsp;</strong>I’d say that my approach tends more toward the spontaneous.&nbsp; A poem will start to assume its shape and fit into a particular genre even before I start writing it, while it’s still somewhat amorphous.&nbsp; I don’t apply technique for its own sake to the material—only when I’m doing an exercise in formal verse as, e.g., writing a sestina using end words randomly picked from the dictionary.&nbsp; Of course, these don’t turn out to be among the most satisfactory pieces.<strong></strong></p><p><strong>PP:</strong>&nbsp; Your work avoids reduction—all the different forms, voices and allusions are astonishing.&nbsp; Your poetry is very wide-ranging.&nbsp; How do you account for this?&nbsp; In<em>The First Hundred Years</em>, there are several poems that aren’t quite dramatic monologues and aren’t personal poems.&nbsp; How do you understand the voices in these poems as functioning?</p><p><strong>RH:&nbsp;</strong>Thank you.&nbsp; I never thought of it being wide-ranging.&nbsp; It’s a mixture of memories and fabrication.&nbsp; Things I’ve studied, observed, or somehow received.&nbsp; The poems in<em>The First Hundred Years</em>&nbsp;are in the voices of various persona, either invented or partially based on reality.&nbsp; I’ve tried to make them work as the stories and thought processes of others, aiming for objectivity and the muting of my own voice, as much as possible.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>PP:</strong>&nbsp; Can you say a little about the process involved in the composition of<em>The First Hundred</em><em>Years</em> and also, by comparison and contrast,<em>The Solitude of Cities</em>?</p><p><strong>RH:&nbsp;</strong>Both<strong></strong>books<strong></strong>evolved over a period of more than twenty years.&nbsp; I had started writing poems on random themes and then realized they could be integrated into these very slim volumes.</p><p><strong>PP:&nbsp;</strong>From reading your poems, I get the impression that there are many influences from all over the world, that your work is very international.&nbsp; In your collection<em>The Solitude of Cities</em>, there are poems about specific places.&nbsp; How have your travels influenced your poetry?</p><p><strong>RH:&nbsp;</strong>I suppose that living in other countries has added to my pool of influences.&nbsp; Although they weren’t exotic places—just villages and towns in Germany, England and Italy—I immersed myself in the environment and paid attention.&nbsp; Although I didn’t realize it at the time.&nbsp; And some of the other international influences are from reading and listening.<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>PP:&nbsp;</strong>I’ve chosen two very different poems from your books to illustrate your writing.&nbsp;&nbsp; The first, “In the Forest,” is about war and the effect of fear on the persona and the second, “L’Air du Temps,” is about a hungry young woman who is too poor to buy food and instead feeds on the fragrance of pastries wafting from a bakery.&nbsp; What drew you to these obviously very different scenarios?</p><p><strong>RH:&nbsp;</strong>The events of “In The Forest” happened to me.&nbsp; As I wrote the poem years later, I realized it might also be a vehicle for referring to the experiences of multitudes of others that I’ve been spared only by chance.&nbsp; And so now I like to think of the poem, however slight, as a tribute to others’ lives and an expression of gratitude for my own.</p><p>“L’Air du Temps,” on the other hand, has only a trace of personal reality.&nbsp; I was picturing the heroines of Jean Rhys’ novels (<em>Voyage In The Dark</em>,<em>Good</em><em>Morning,</em><em>Midnight</em> and<em>After</em><em>Leaving</em><em>Mr</em>.<em>Mackenzie</em>) and identifying the narrator with them.&nbsp; That’s the specific “story” with its “protective pages.”&nbsp;&nbsp; In the background are also old songs by Aznavour and Trenet.&nbsp; The perfume, too.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>PP:</strong>&nbsp; Tracing poetic influence is always popular with readers.&nbsp; When you started writing who were the poets you admired?<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Whom do you find to admire amongst your contemporaries and among the newer poets?<strong></strong></p><p><strong>RH:&nbsp;</strong>The<strong></strong>first poet I read was Burns, and I admire him still, his simplicity and humor.&nbsp; Then Shakespeare, of course, and the English Romantics, Baudelaire, Rimbaud, Housman, Rilke, Yeats, Dylan Thomas,<strong></strong>Cavafy, Seferis.&nbsp; Contemporary poets I appreciate are Anthony Hecht, Gerald Stern, Charles Wright, Philip Levine, Charles Simic, Jane Shore, Gary Soto, D. Nurkse, Seamus Heaney, Jeffrey Harrison, A.E. Stallings, Kim Addonizio.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>PP:</strong>&nbsp; Taking the reader from the discussion of your poetry, I’d like to move on to your haibun. Can you describe your concept of haibun?</p><p><strong>RH:&nbsp;</strong>No particular concept; I haven’t been writing them long enough to develop that perspective.&nbsp; I try with haibun, as with any other poetic genre, to provide the reader with a few enjoyable, perhaps surprising, moments.&nbsp; The relation of the prose to the haiku is the crux; why some of the “leaps” work and some don’t is difficult to explain.&nbsp; But you know it when you see it, and also when it’s absent.<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>PP:&nbsp;</strong>The discipline needed to achieve status in the poetry world will obviously inform your approach to writing haibun.&nbsp; Are there ways in which your poetry background has influenced your haibun?<strong></strong></p><p><strong>RH:&nbsp;</strong>I view all types of poetry as being demanding and requiring a great deal of discipline, both in the initial writing and in the revision process.&nbsp; It’s unlikely I’ll achieve any sort of status; I’m pleased to think that a few people might be reading something of mine that resonates for them.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>PP:</strong>&nbsp; Your haibun contain many references to your personal experiences and to travel.&nbsp; We usually distinguish between author and persona in a poem.&nbsp; To what extent does this distinction apply to your poetry?</p><p><strong>RH:&nbsp;</strong>The author rarely makes an appearance.&nbsp; I enjoy the freedom of creating a persona, maintaining the distinction.&nbsp; I’m not fond of so-called confessional poetry.<strong></strong></p><p><strong>PP:&nbsp;</strong>Since haibun starts out as “a story that needs telling,” how much attention do you then pay to stylistic elements?&nbsp; In what ways do you work on syntax, phrasings, finding the right ways to communicate your story?</p><p><strong>RH:&nbsp;</strong>The style is very important, it’s what makes a piece coherent.&nbsp; So I work on stylistic elements the best I can. It’s necessary to keep the prose moving along, avoiding flatness of expression,&nbsp; bare description, repetitive phrasing, etc.&nbsp; Variation is important.&nbsp; And self-sufficiency of the prose.&nbsp; The haiku can’t carry the whole weight.<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>PP:&nbsp;</strong>You may start out with a simple thought or idea but the imagery you use is often quite complex.&nbsp; So do you make demands on your readers’ imagination?&nbsp; Is that an important part of your craft for you?</p><p><strong>RH:</strong>&nbsp; I don’t introduce complexity on purpose, and hope my writing isn’t too demanding.&nbsp; I don’t think it’s part of my craft at all, at least not intentionally.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>PP:</strong>&nbsp; How much do you revise texts that you’ve written?&nbsp; What is your process of revising?</p><p><strong>RH:</strong>&nbsp; I revise over and over.&nbsp; Some pieces have been worked on for years.&nbsp; When revising, I aim for greater concision, fresher language, a more logical progression of thought, rhythm, phrasing, the overtones of words, other possible layers of meaning.&nbsp; I let poems cool off for days or weeks before reading them again.&nbsp; I consider what is necessary to the poem, rather than to the writer, and what should be omitted, even if it’s a favorite line.&nbsp; And what’s irrelevant, too much information.&nbsp; I usually end up with a minimalist version of the original.</p><p><strong>PP:&nbsp;</strong>In your haibun “Heimerzheim,” you sum up so well the three characters, plus yourself, in this brief poem.&nbsp; You are able to contain their characters in just a few words of description.&nbsp; Does this kind of descriptive quality come easily to you?</p><p><strong>RH:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Absolutely not.&nbsp; Almost every word involves a struggle.</p><p><strong>PP:&nbsp;</strong>As a general rule, how do you compose an individual text?&nbsp; Why do you write and how did you write a particular text?&nbsp; For instance, perhaps you could say how you came to write your haibun “Via dei Fiori”?</p><p><strong>RH:&nbsp;</strong>This is difficult to answer.&nbsp; I don’t exactly go into a trance, but I don’t understand the process of composition very well.&nbsp; I’m just not conscious of it.&nbsp; I think about the poem for quite a while before I start writing.&nbsp; Then it comes out in words that often seem to be waiting there.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>“Via dei Fiori” has some elements of autobiography, so I had memories and impressions to work with as a start.&nbsp; Then I wanted to keep the genders of all the characters unspecified, to bring out the universality of desire, frustration and farewell.</p><p><strong>PP:</strong>&nbsp; In that particular haibun, the speaker sounds depressed.&nbsp; It’s quite a sad poem and then there’s the line “I could rely on you for anything: a place to stay, money whenever you had it, glasses of fiery cognac, a ride to Fiumicino.”&nbsp; That line makes me smile.&nbsp; I was wondering how important humour is for you, with regard to your work.</p><p><strong>RH:&nbsp;</strong>Depressed is probably my default voice, but I didn’t realize it was speaking so loudly here.&nbsp; Humour is important in my work&#
I stumbled on a squad<br />
of camouflaged soldiers,<br />
stealthy in the underbrush.</p><p>They halted their maneuvers<br />
at a brief command,<br />
deployed into columns<br />
on both sides of the path.</p><p>Silently, they knelt,<br />
as one man, they raised<br />
weapons to shoulders,<br />
barrels aimed upward,</p><p>forcing me to advance beneath the nave<br />
of a leafy cathedral ribbed with rifles.</p><p>Later I learned about<em>Spalier,</em><br />
how it’s considered a great honor.<br />
And all along I had thought<br />
they were going to shoot.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>First published in<em>The First Hundred Years</em>, Ruth Holzer, Finishing Line Press, 2004</p><P class="paragraph-center"><img src="#
and buying something for her hunger,</p><p>she breathes deliciously deep<br />
past bakeries at daybreak,</p><p>absorbing the sourdough smell of loaves,<br />
the sugary fragrance of crepes.</p><p>Steep alleyways to the marketplace<br />
she climbs, inhaling fresh cheese and grapes.</p><p>For supper, along the terraces, a breeze<br />
bears creamy coffee, chocolate bitterness</p><p>that she ravenously draws through her body<br />
to stay alive overnight, and she sometimes</p><p>snatches a waft of amber beer as it floats<br />
from bars where everyone is singing.</p><p>Aroma of hours: living inside a story,<br />
she feels the protective pages fluttering all around.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>First published in<em>The Solitude of Cities,</em> Ruth Holzer, Finishing Line Press, 2006</p><p class="paragraph-center"><img src="#
