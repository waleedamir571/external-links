No one living in the small town remembers when the retired poet living the small life moved into the small house. It happened quietly and seamlessly. Yes, life is simple and slow-paced in the small town, but still, it was no small feat that the retired poet could pull it off. The small town residents were ever respectful of the retired poet’s small life. Curious as they were, they never felt right asking. To ask would be more than a bit rude and prying, they thought. Still, the big question burns in the minds of the small town residents. Call it small town trepidation or misplaced mores, but all resisted the dare to rap on the door of the small house where the retired poet lives to ask: Can a poet really retire from poetry?</p><p class="centertalics"><em>no hoopla</em><br /><em>a single ant<br />
