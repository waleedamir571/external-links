They were once conversant in spoon<em>clang-a-lang</em> and knife<em>skritch</em>.&nbsp; They practiced daily.&nbsp; An extended family serving together despite the lost teacup or plate chipped beyond repair.&nbsp; Everyday dwindled to Sundays until finally the occasional birthday was their only furlough from the dusty cupboard.&nbsp; Their stories did resonate but eventually I would crave fresh air so I’d replace the meat platters and serving bowls and go outside to the white pine woods.<p  class="centertalics"><em>winter birds</em><br /><em>beneath the sunken branches</em><br /><em>of arborvitae</em><br /><em>I huddle in a snowdrift</em><br /><em>that smells faintly of cedar</em></p></tr></table><p align='center'><img src="#
