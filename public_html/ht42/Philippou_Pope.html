Up a flight of eight steps, I pass through the wooden doors into my classroom sanctuary. I raise my hand, as usual, to ring the bell for morning break. When that time comes, I race up the staircase to the belfry and bolt the door behind me. I reach for the rope and soar through the air to the soothing sound of the bell.<P align="center"><em>Quasimodo<br />

sweeps a gentle hand<br />
across his gargoyles<br />
watching over the city</em><P align="center"><em>Esmeralda saved<br />

about the cathedral<br />

and

Her doll’s hair is festooned with ribbons that lost their luster long ago—its tiny feet limp under the skirt, forehead’s ridged with dirt, arms bruised purple with stains, eyes glassy and wide-open to the illimitable blue. I pick up the doll and hand it to her. I speak in the language I know best, and slowly, she in hers.<P align="center"><em>Nebuchadnezzar<br />
