It is a big voice, crosses the room and you hear it outside the door. Each word chimes alone like he is calling role: the names of every doubter, every teacher, and every tutor shaking in his voice. You get what you expect and nobody expected much.</p><p align="justify">I&rsquo;m not about to stop him and say, &ldquo;You need to read the words smoothly like someone who is talking&rdquo; or &ldquo;You have to read the words all together.&rdquo; No, I am letting him go, letting him open all the windows, all at once. He deserves that much.</p><p align="center"><em>empty classroom</em><br /><em>desks still warm</em><br /><em>from the hands</em></p></tr></table><p align='center'><p align='center'><img src="#
