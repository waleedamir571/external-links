Flight Patterns</strong></p><table width="75%" border="0" align="center"><tr><td height="216" valign="top"><blockquote><p align="justify"><span class="font12">Supposing that someone has often flown in his dreams, and that at last, as soon as he dreams, he is conscious of the power and art of flying as his privilege and his peculiarly enviable happiness; such a person, who believes that on the slightest impulse, he can actualize all sorts of curves and angles, who knows the sensation of a certain divine levity, an "upwards" without effort or constraint, a "downwards" without descending or lowering—without trouble. . . .</span><p align="center" class="font12">                                                                                                                     
Nietzsche,<em>Beyond Good and Evil,</em> §193</p></blockquote><p align="justify">&nbsp;</p><p align="center"><em>a Brown Pelican<br />
rising from the bay<br />
slow to start<br />
his great rowing of the air<br />
sails away</em><p align="justify"> 
In love enough with himself to fit in anywhere; after a long day sweating in the cornfield, he settles comfortably on the pickup tailgate and talks bushel price with the workers over a couple of beers.  Later on, he signs the final papers on his new Porsche, grinning like a kid.  He is flying as he turns onto the freeway.<p align="center"><em>the sun's last<br />
brightness, light's angle<br />
flattening the sea, blue<br />
on the cusp of red<br />
and the wind settles</em><p align="justify"> 
The great Leader's drama—forced to abdicate and flee, finish his days in a foreigner's house, in someone else's shoes.  He cannot imagine it.  He who has lived at such heights, how the mundane weighs down his wings, the air too thick to breathe.<p align="center"><em>Hokusai's famous woodcut<br />
of a wave<br />
beside the window<br />
where I watch<br />
and listen to the surf</em><p align="justify"> 
In youth we cannot wait and that's a good thing when you consider just how long we are going to have to wait.  If the young could truly imagine how distant their future, how late it will likely be, how wrinkled and frail their dreams will appear. . . .<p align="center"><em>on their sides<br />
