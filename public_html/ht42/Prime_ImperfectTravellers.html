My companion doesn't like China: people coughing and spitting, skinny gun-toting soldiers in baggy green uniforms, meat stalls covered with flies, live chickens hung upside down from handle bars.  She adds: song birds in cages, the way people lean in around her; she feels she can hardly breathe the dense air.  We talk about New Zealand where you can drive all day past the same farmland and there's the scenery of forest and ocean on either side, chanting past the windows.  She loves the immensity, she says, and the way she can lose herself inside it.  But I feel lost already, I want to say, in the small crack that has opened between us.</tr></table><p align='center'><img src="#
