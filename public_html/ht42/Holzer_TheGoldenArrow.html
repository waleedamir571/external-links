She's off to Paris for the first time, on the boat train from Victoria, clattering with excitement through the yellow fields of Kent.  On the Dover ferry she watches the cliffs vanish in the twilight and wonders with a pang if she'll ever see them again.  She falls asleep on the French train in an empty compartment, her head nestled against her pack.<p align="center"><em>over the river<br />

She's startled awake by a stout man sliding the door open.  He sits across from her and at once begins talking.  He's a Cypriot in the import-export business.  Before that, he was somewhat of a war hero, but he's too modest to go into details.  He comes to Paris often, knows a nice hotel near the station, clean, very reasonable rates.  Would she like to go there with him?  Tomorrow he'll show her all around the city, he promises, as the train pulls in to the Gare du Nord.<p align="center"><em>cathedral gloomâ€”<br />
