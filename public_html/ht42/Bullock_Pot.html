Eventually I was popped out in the shed – abandoned!<P align="justify">For a time I was used by the husband to put clothes pegs in, but when the handle broke on the favourite enamel I was brought back inside. She decided I wasn’t as far gone as she’d first thought.<P align="justify">So, restored to duty, I cradled leeks, carrots and mushrooms and once, when her father came to stay, she made a saffron sauce. Unfortunately, the husband threw me out for good at that point.<P align="justify">I’ve been at the bottom of this garden now for twenty-one years. The birds have been good company, though some away months at a time, like men on oil-rigs. The other day a grandchild picked me up, tipped out the old nest and made puddings of mud and snails, which I enjoyed more than the saffron.<p align="center"><em>early morning<br>a thousand chores<br>occur to leaves</em></p><p align="center"><em>not long<br>before green shoots<br>turn brown</em></p><p align="center"><em>stalks making<br>short rhythms<br>on bark</em></p></tr></table><p>&nbsp;</p><hr noshade="noshade" /><p align="center">&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></td><td width="10%" valign="top" bgcolor="#
