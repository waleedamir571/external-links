 A friend talks me into attending a musical comedy class. For weeks I climb the creaky wooden stairs on the west side of Manhattan to be intimidated by Broadway belters and lyric sopranos, red-haired showgirls carrying special musical arrangements, baritones wearing platform shoes. A  Brooklyn woman collects fees while Mervyn the guru moves about smoking cigarettes and hugging people:<em>so happy to and where have you and oh my god and wouldn't you know and darling I would have to be and look who's here</em> . . . After many weeks, I finally decide I am too scared to sing; I will instead recite a poem.<em>OK</em>, my friend says,<em>if that's all you think you can do. Do that.</em> I feel like throwing up. As I get onstage, I hear noisy chatter over coffee: names of agents, who's casting, open call, let me write that down, yeah she's on tour, but did you hear. Somebody laughs, the door slams, Mervyn shouts<em>OK everyone quiet down</em>, and strikes a match for another cigarette as I begin.<p align="left"><em> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a long time now<br />

The room is listening. I go on.<p align="left"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attendants here<br />

The match burns down in Mervyn's hand.<p align="center"><em>falling rain<br />
