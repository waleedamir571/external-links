Inwardly, we all know the war of impulses is never over.  Each of us is a cacophony of competing desires, lusts, appetites, fears, needs. . . childishness. The way sufficient order is established in the person, sufficient in the sense that we can go about a roughly peaceful daily life, is domination.  One impulse rises to the top.<p align="center"><em>among bees<br />

Things as they are, as they have been, often turn out to be boring; the same old food, people, and games disappoint our fancies.  We are perhaps cursed with insatiable desires, desires we learn temporarily to deflect or confuse, but in the end, dams can break and floods come roaring out and carry everything away.<p align="center"><em>every cycle<br />

Long hours of careful sanding and shaping, following the natural curve of the wood, gone in an instant—along a nearly invisible line of grain, the graceful wooden arm split in two.  It started right at the base of the slender thumb and shattered just above the elbow.  My father's face tightened, his lips stretched over his clenched teeth, and, in a rage of curses, he threw the pieces hard against the stones. Turning toward me, he shouted—"God damn you! What were you doing?"<p align="center"><em>art triggers<br />

Notes:<p align="justify">The Satura Menippea, "a medley of prose and verse [<em>lit.</em> 'a mixed dish'] treating of all kinds of subjects just as they came to hand in the plebeian style. . . . Menippus of Gadara, the originator of this style of composition, lived about 280 B.C.; he interspersed jocular and commonplace topics with moral maxims and philosophical doctrines. . . ."<blockquote><p align="justify">
