Several points measured four to six inches long, too broad and heavy for arrow tips.&nbsp; These spearheads probably tipped darts or atlatls.&nbsp; Once he and his brother Jack tried to flint knap their own arrowheads, but all they got were bruised hands and bloody fingers.&nbsp; No, these points were the real deal.&nbsp; He stashed them in an old ammunition box at the back of his closet.&nbsp;</p><p align="center"><em>sorting his belongings . . .<br />
