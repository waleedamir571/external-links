Turning out of the gate, I come to a stop. The lane is blocked by two donkeys in a boxing match. They rear up on their hind legs and paw at the air, then land with a thud and make a quick hop to grab the other by the neck. Neither seems very keen to better the other, and they repeat the moves again and again. For a moment, I think it's donkey foreplay, but as they dance around one another, I can see it's a contest between two males. It's diverting and I'm in no hurry, so decide not to honk my horn.<p align="center"><em>brisk morning<br />

The beggar woman who trolls the neighborhood bends down and picks up a large stone. She eyes me for a moment and, smiling, takes a wild shot at the donkeys. It's a perfect miss, but the donkeys are startled and trot off. The beggar comes to my window and demands payment for her services.</tr></table><p align='center'><img src="#
