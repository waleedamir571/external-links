We like to visit a co-op cafe in our Moscow neighborhood, one of the new private enterprises that Gorbachev has encouraged; they have more and better food than most of the state restaurants, and are never "Closed for Repairs" when the employees feel like taking a day off, never display "No Vacancy" signs when the place is empty. The staff are solicitous and polite, and apologetic if something on the menu doesn't happen to be available, instead of incredulous that you might ever have expected it would be.<p align="center"><em>winter flea marketâ€”<br />

It drives the staff crazy if I order for myself instead of letting my boyfriend do it for me. For this reason, I make a point of always ordering for myself, and always before he does. They stare ferociously at him while I speak, and only after he gives a slight nod do they write down my order. Even after I've been doing this for months, they don't yield on their principles. No one there ever asks me what I want.<p align="justify">
I eat my chicken Kiev watching them as they bustle from table to table with worried lines in their foreheads, as if they're calculating profit margins in their heads. Butter drips down my chin. My boyfriend reaches over and wipes it off with a napkin.<p align="center"><em>meteor shower<br />
