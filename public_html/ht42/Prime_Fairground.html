I can smell the brine; see the drip of ice cream cones as we strolled across the road towards the beach.  It was here I and my sister and her boyfriend played in the tide pools.  Out of sight our parents sheltered behind a breakwater.<P align="justify">The three of us went to the fair: octopus, aerial swing, house of horrors, ghost train; the stickiness of toffee apples, candy flow and sticks of pink rock with the name of the seaside all the way through.  There was the slow calm of the Ferris wheel; my sister and her boyfriend above me strangely buoyant.  Their voices were as distant as the clouds.  Afterwards, the descent and the release from the sky.  Alighting, they took my hands, felt inside my clutched palm for the last of the fairground tickets; a ‘child’ ticket for me on the bumper cars.<P align="center"><em>years later<br />
I recall being<br />
the ‘gooseberry,’<br />
the unease in something<br />
I sensed but didn’t understand</em><P align="center"><em>the image returns<br />
of a thirteen year old girl<br />
so lovely in the photo<br />
so uncertain of herself<br />
and her part as voyeur</em><P align="center"><em>the dividing line<br />
between teenager<br />
and young woman<br />
acceptable<br />
in that shivery uncertainty</em></tr></table><p>&nbsp;</p><hr noshade="noshade" /><p align="center">&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></td><td width="10%" valign="top" bgcolor="#
