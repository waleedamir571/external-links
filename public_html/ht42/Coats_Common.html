He worked best alone and that is what he told my father. My father (the owner of the garage door business) told him in return that his son had a family now, two young children and no classes to teach that summer, and no ifs, ands, or buts, I would be Wayne’s helper.<P align="center"><em>evening swallows<br>I try out the weight<br>of a new hammer</em><P align="justify">The work was divided in half. My job was to fasten the hardware and locks to the garage door sections then stack them: bottom, lock, intermediate, top, in each garage door opening. Wayne took care of the vertical and horizontal tracks as well as the torsion bars and springs. I wrote down the instructions I was given in a notebook that I left open at each new job site.<P align="center"><em>no lessons<br>key in the lock<br>upside down</em><P align="justify">A few weeks passed and I had peppered Wayne with every question I could think of. He smoked menthol cigarettes and answered with a few words. Wayne ate no lunch and if the tracks were ready before my sections, he lay down on the concrete floors and slept for twenty minutes while I caught up.<P align="center"><em>late June<br>a pocket of cool<br>close to the floor</em><P align="justify">Midway through that summer and we were installing a large door. I struggled to stack sixteen foot sections in an opening. Wayne was taking a nap. I woke him when all of the sections were in place and he stood and stared for a time at my work. He told me the glass section was in wrong after he never showed me the correct procedure in the first place.  “What is wrong with you?” I yelled. “What in the world did I ever do to you? I am here for a month then I’m gone, back to teaching, out of your hair, and you can’t even hold a conversation.” I went on and on like a lawyer filling the air with words.<P align="justify">Afterwards, Wayne and I took the door apart, changed a few hinges around and bolted it back together. On the ride home, he spoke for a long time about his wife and his three children. We were in no hurry to reach the shop.<P align="center"><em>afternoon shadows<br>tension keeps the doors<br>from falling down</em></tr></table><p>&nbsp;</p><hr noshade="noshade" /><p align="center">&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></td><td width="10%" valign="top" bgcolor="#
