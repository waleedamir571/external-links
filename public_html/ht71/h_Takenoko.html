<p align="justify">
As far as I know, James Mason has never starred in any films of <em>Jane Eyre</em>—though he might well have done.  My opening lines in this piece should have been <em>Your name, little girl</em>?

<p align="justify"><strong>Stagecraft</strong>

<p align="justify">I've usually found the locals in my village more than willing enough to talk; and looking back, I still wonder why she took so long to approach me.  Had I then seemed aloof, or had she later become more desperate?  When I moved here some nine years ago, she was the first person I had really noticed.   The bright self-set trendiness of her clothes, from the 'butcher's boy' cap to her calf-length boots; and her billowing flowered skirts as she cycled the busy High Street with carefree competence, took me back to London of the 60s&70s—King's Road, Carnaby Street, and Portobello Road markets.  I'd sometimes smile and nod in recognition. Then, one day last year, there she was, crossing the road to confront me with a cheerful winning smile (not at all bad looking!):

<p align="justify"><em>Have you ever acted?  Only the fool.  Would you like to try?  Not especially. 
 
</em>
<p align="justify">Few days later, I have succumbed; the trap has closed and the strategy unfolded.  I am to play Mr Brocklehurst in Jane Eyre—<em>Oh, and probably the vicar—we're really short of older men—and we'll need you to make up sets in The Grand Ballroom Scene</em>.  Now she tells me!  <em>But I can't dance! . . .  You'll be fine</em>.  And that's it.  A once-upon-a-time lecturer, I know how to project my voice; but no, I am not James Mason, nor was meant to be.

<p align="justify">Rehearsals are frenetic, especially for the dancing; and with no directions or comment as to my acting, I learn, two days to go, what I will not be able to do because the set won't allow it.  And she has been watching me strut my stuff for four months!  First night, luckily poorly attended, I meet the young Jane on stage and utter my first immortal lines <em>Your name, Jane Eyre</em>?  Amazingly, thereafter we play to packed houses; and all goes well—well, almost.  As the last applause dies away, she is crossing the floor to throw her arms around me <em>Darling, you were wonderful—do come to the party</em>.  I sneak away—not my scene.  But fame follows me down the High Street for the next few days.  And one year on, here she is again, ringing my bell.  I feign out.  


<p align="center">A mere mechanic <br />
on this stage called Life—youngsters<br />
teaching me to tap-dance!
