<p align="justify">

In 1951, my family boarded a ship to cross from New York City to Israel. My father was twenty-seven. My mother was twenty-five. And I was just shy of my third birthday. Israel, newly formed in 1948, was in desperate need of doctors. My father, an idealistic Zionist, had just completed his medical training. 

<p align="justify">Not only was Israel short of doctors . . . they were short of practically everything. It was a time of austerity: <em>tzena</em>. Furniture was rationed. So were shoes and foodâ€”especially food. Some items, such as fish and bread, were readily available. Others, such as flour, sugar, and oil were extremely scarce.

<p align="justify">As a family of three, our food coupon book entitled us to one egg a week. My parents, naturally, reserved the egg for me. And thus began The Weekly Ceremony of the Egg. My mother would carefully scramble, fry, or soft-boil the egg and present it to me. I would stare at the egg as it sat, alone and unadorned, on a small plate. It seemed to stare back at me. "Eat it, <em>Estherke</em>,"my mother would urge. "It's an egg. It's <em>good</em>." I would watch the egg slowly congeal on the plate, my mother's voice growing increasingly desperate, and my stomach growing increasingly queasy. Occasionally I could be persuaded to take a miniscule bite. Generally I was able to outlast my mother.

<p align="justify">We remained in Israel for a year. 52 weeks. 52 eggs.

<p align="justify">Six decades later, my husband and I live in California. John Steinbeck country. Agricultural land; what one of Steinbeck's characters calls "pastures of heaven." The roadside stands and grocery stores overflow with every kind of food imaginable.
