<p align="justify"><strong>1. The Track Divides</strong>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="left" class="font12">Two roads diverged in a wood, and I,<br />
I took the road less traveled by<br /><br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—Robert Frost

</blockquote>

<p align="justify">The track goes on through a dark oak wood. Two black figures walk ahead of me in the sunken bridleway, a holloway worn down by the feet and hooves of history. The track divides.

<p align="center">where<br />
are we going today<br />
St Jacques<br />
our patron saint<br />
of pilgrimage

<p align="justify">One of my companions stands, arms folded, on the direct shorter path. The other sits, arms folded, beside the longer but more scenic path. Carefully I estimate distances. Half way between them, I long to slash the atmosphere with my trekking poles. 

<p align="center">my candle burns<br />
in an ancient shrine . . .<br />
Ave Maria<br />
Gratia Plena<br />

<p align="justify">We take the longer path. It's a fragment of the old pilgrims' way, the Voie de Tours, one of four routes that converge to form the Camino Frances leading to Santiago de Compostella.

<p align="center">once they walked<br />
this long straight track . . .<br />

twitter of birds

<p align="justify">We cross a muddy creek on an old stone bridge. Is that a gravestone embedded in it? Mosquitoes swarm. For a thousand years they and their ancestors have drawn pilgrims' blood.  Then an engraved milestone: it's 860 km to Santiago. I feel tired, sit down in the noonday heat.

<p align="justify"><strong>2. Fragments

</strong>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="left" class="font12">And the end of all our journeying<br />
Will be to arrive where we started<br />
And know the place for the first time.<br /><br />

</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">I wake in the grey dawn knowing what I need to do. Walk down St John Street, past the cathedral to the river. On the Millennium Bridge I tear up my <em>credencial</em> and throw the fragments in the river. I watch them float away, and with them, all the sweat of a 400 km walk, the torture of crowded hostels, all the sadness of a family breakup.

<p align="center">three pilgrims<br />
went walking in France<br />
and in Spain<br />
couldn't find signposts<br />
and so lost their Way

<p align="justify"><em>Tide's  on the ebb and the fragments are carried out to sea. Will some end up at Finis Terre, the end of the known world? I'll never reach it now. The wind carries my song to Spain "It's time . . . to say goodbye." The sky weeps. Gentle, bitter tears.

</em>
<p align="center">every morning<br />
I wake at five<br />
ready|
<br />
to move on—<br />
but the track has vanished

<p align="justify">Why did my journey end at Puente la Reina, a little town in northern Spain?  I was disorientated in Spain, didn't know a word of the language. And there was a split in the trio. One pilgrim was walking on ahead, and I felt unsupported.

<p align="center">when you walk<br />
the same dusty pathway<br />
your boots<br />
become the same colour<br />
but do your souls merge?

<p align="justify">And I was tired. Twenty days on the track from Bordeaux and feeling the impact on an ageing body, I needed a rest day. But when we reached that town I knew that I couldn't go a single step further.

<p align="center">black pastel<br />
borders my page<br />
a dark shadow<br />
strides towards<br />
Santiago

<p align="justify">Was there something in the fetid air, the narrow streets of that dark mediaeval town? Heavily churched, it is the junction of ancient pilgrimage routes from France. Did my cells carry some ancestral memory? What happened at Puente la Reina in 1492?  What spooked me? And one of my fellow pilgrims also turned back there. Was she spooked?

<p align="justify"><strong>3. Over the Ocean</strong>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="left" class="font12">My Bonnie lies over the ocean<br /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—Traditional Scottish song

</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">"My body lies over the ocean . . . !" Oh no it doesn't, it's my mind that's over there these days. A hangover from the Camino. Is it two months since?

<p align="justify">My body was there!  Sweating summer through the dogpoo'd roads of France; hauling itself over the high Pyrenees; pounding the dusty tracks of Spain—tracks lined with toilet paper. My body ached and groaned and after three weeks had had enough.

<p align="center">sore shins<br />
and gastrocnemius<br />
tortured quads<br />
and tender tendons . . .<br />
twinges in the glutes

<p align="justify">That's when my mind took over. My inner Camino began when my outer Camino finished. Body returned to London, Stockholm, Sydney, Canberra, family, friends. Returned to dance, sing, cook, write, ride a bike.

<p align="justify">But Mind failed to return. It stayed out there. Was it because one fellow pilgrim was still walking on to Santiago? because I was angry with her? jealous? Was it because I felt guilty, ashamed of running away, leaving her out there? because I felt the pain of separation, of lost love?

<p align="center">blinded . . .<br />
can't see the Way<br />
lost<br />
on a long hard road<br />
that's paved with tears

<p align="justify">I walked for twenty days, churned for forty. Ancient advice kept coming up in my head: "sit with it, that loaded brick of grief!"

<p align="center">might have been<br />
never will be<br />
sad<br />
shivers my belly<br />
journey unfinished

<p align="justify">And I did sit with it.  I sat it out.  The old dark stuff rose to the surface, out into the sunlight of an austral spring morning.

<p align="center">finishing<br />
the journey<br />
looking<br />
backwards at the path . . .<br />
standing on the threshold
