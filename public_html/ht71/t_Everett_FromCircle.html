<p align="justify">The mist clears, but I am still no more than a speck in the jackdaw's eye. He who watches from the topmost bough of the yellowing oak becomes two, then twelve, then twenty. They perch in pairs, chuntering like old married couples. No stone is older than their story.

<p align="justify">On the road that cuts south to north through the Henge, a car backfires, and for a moment the air is all wings. But the Swindon stone stands firm, as it has for 4500 years, balanced on one corner, only shin-deep in the ground. A giantess, in the twilight and the half-light, arms akimbo, she can do nothing but wait.

<p align="center">her time-bearing hips<br />
shape a skirt of weathered stone<br />
my cheek cold as she<br />
I listen for earth's blood,<br />
moon's breath, the tick of stars

<p align="justify">Her partner, a sarsen that dwarfed her, casts the long shadow of absence. Perhaps it is for him she searches when, at midnight, she crosses the road. On moonless nights she turns on her axis, like the spirits of the Windmill Hill dead in the weeds of their plundered graves.

<p align="center">on the Avenue<br />
from Henge to Sanctuary<br />
gooseflesh as we pass<br />
brushing shoulders with the ones<br />
who raised the stones

<p align="justify">And the ones who razed them to the ground.

<p align="center">passing through<br />
the barber-surgeon<br />
places his hands, so—<br />
an albino crow<br />
spreads its wings

<p align="center">a leather purse<br />
of 14th century coins,<br />
scissors and a probe . . .<br />
the one he would bury<br />
becomes his headstone

<p align="justify">But the worst was yet to come. All the while the sarsens kept mum, their dust bloodied the hands that dug the pit and toppled the stone, the hands that gathered straw and lit the fire until the beast smoked with the heat. Then came water and hissing steam, the crack that broke the stone boar's back, the blow of the sledgehammer that finished the deed.  Under the foremanship of one they later dubbed <em>Herostratus</em>, a village took shape, along with a chapel.

<p align="justify">But there were others—

<p align="center">antiquarians<br />
sketching  and dreaming<br />
a serpentine plan . . .<br />
the Marmalade Man<br />
resurrecting the stones

<p align="justify">I walk the outer circle, stepping slowly from light to shadow, shadow to light.  I feel the cold shudder, here and there, of someone crossing my grave.

<p align="justify">Holes in the face of a stone; evidence of long entanglement with  ancient roots on the Marlborough Downs. Enough to stir the hand of idle curiosity, which takes up a walking cane and pokes the darkness, dislodging in the process, a gleaming ball of chalk. It was amidst a vast chalk-scape that this bauble last sparkled in the sun, moments before a Neolithic child discovered that it fit so snugly in her palm . . .

<p align="center">grey wethers<br />
grazing the fields of time<br />
hands of windblown dust<br />
dug your ditch with antler-picks,<br />
shepherded you to your fold

<p align="center">guardians of a people,<br />
custodians of the land . . .<br />
once strangers<br />
like the Saracens <br />
from whom you took your name 

<p align="center">what if sandstone<br />
could hack the ages from<br />
its quartz-flecked craw?<br />
a jackdaw settles<br />
on the Devil's Chair

<p align="center">through hip-high grass<br />
Meadow Brown butterflies<br />
ghosts<br />
of the procession<br />
from Circle to Tomb

<p align="center">a chink of light<br />
in the Long Barrow<br />
of a dream<br />
words brushed from the lintel<br />
twirling through gold

<p align="justify"><span class="font12"><strong>Author's Notes</strong>: <em>Sarsen</em> is a Wiltshire dialect pronunciation of the word Saracen. From a distance, within the landscape, the stones resemble  sheep, hence <em>grey wethers</em>, a popular name for them.

</span>
<p align="justify"><span class="font12">The 'antiquarians': John Aubrey (1626-1697) from whom Avebury takes
its name; William Stukely (1687-1765) who believed the Henge and its avenues were a representation of a giant serpent; Alexander Keiller (1889-1955) who purchased the monument in the 1930s with money from the family's marmalade business and restored many of the buried stones to their rightful positions.

</span>
<p align="justify"><span class="font12"><em>Herostratus</em>: The ancient Greek who is said to have burnt down the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus. Here, it refers to Tom Robinson, responsible for demolishing many of the stones in the 17th century, whom Stukely awarded the title, <em>Herostratus of Avebury</em>.

</span>
<p align="justify" class="font12">The Barber Stone: during his 1930s excavations, Keiller uncovered the skeleton of a man under one of the stones. A purse and its contents, buried with him, suggest he was an itinerant barber-surgeon.</td>
