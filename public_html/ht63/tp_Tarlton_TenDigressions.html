Ten Digressions on Wallace Stevens

</strong></p>

 


<p align="left">


<strong>1. Of a Kind</strong> 


<blockquote>
<p align="left">

<em>It is not to be seen beneath the appearances<br />
That tell of it. The steeple at Farmington<br />
Stands glistening and Haddam shines and sways.</em></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—Wallace Stevens </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">

Professor Titus led the seminar on teaching.  He covered all the important things—like dressing to look older, you know, tweedy jackets and ties, learning to walk around the front of the room, but never getting so far from your notes that you couldn’t just stroll by them to pick up the thread, and, finally, this: “Find an earlier book on the subject of your course, take it out of the library and keep it out.  Base all your lectures on it.”
 
 
<p align="center">
peas in a pod<br />
remember when you slipped me<br />
the handshake<br />
we stood in a room full<br />
of Sultans, none the wiser
 
 
<p align="center">
we had agreed<br />
never to talk politics<br />
so we could fight<br />
about such virtues as Scotch<br />
how dry’s a dry Martini
 
 
<p align="center">
Americans<br />
on a narrow stone back street<br />
somewhere in Spain—<br />
we laughed about baseball<br />
your hat said “Los Angeles”
 
 

<br /><br />
<p align="left">



<strong>2. As the Nose on Your Face</strong> 


<blockquote>
<p align="left">

<em>None of them are strange,<br />
With socks of lace<br />
And beaded ceintures.</em><br />
<em></em></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—Wallace Stevens </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">

I was wondering about all the kinds of things they make us all dress up the same for . . . being on a team, football, say, all the guys in identical pants and jerseys.  What about the military? At the Coast Guard Academy it always caught me by surprise—all of us dressed up in white jumpers.  Did you ever see the first Allied photos of the prisoners at Dachau, their striped uniform jackets and pants, everyone’s head shaved?
 
 
<p align="center">
plainest people<br />
coming slowly into view<br />
wear common cloth<br />
coarse featured amniotic skulls<br />
hair tied with fish heads
 
 
<p align="center">
someone’s mother<br />
now she’s crowding to the front<br />
waving papers<br />
trying to catch the eye<br />
where, propitiously, a judge
 
 
<p align="center">
making friction<br />
between invisibly rocky<br />
abraded edges<br />
making the same, the same<br />
it’s taking forever
 
 
<br /><br />

<strong>3. Sheik of Araby</strong> 


<blockquote>
<p align="left">

<em>Like a bracelet<br />
Shaken in a dance</em>.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—Wallace Stevens </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">

It was in Granada in 1967, at a Gypsy Flamenco carnival on the outskirts of town.  There was a long makeshift street with temporary cantinas in tents on both sides; as we walked through, the music of one barely died down before the next would rise up and wash over us.  A woman in a red dress, her shoes pounding on the temporary floor like little hammers, the guitar strummed roughly as if being punished, and the cheering.  We stood with our little glasses of wine, amazed.
 
 
<p align="center">
on the sublime<br />
wrist of Yvonne De Carlo<br />
whose hot eyes<br />
on a shimmering desert<br />
young men with parched throats
 
 
<p align="center">
breathéd <em>morae</em><br />
counting fives and sevens<br />
music to dance<br />
the high spiraling flute<br />
quick and repetitious drum
 
 
<p align="center">
rich carpets thrown<br />
on the sand, draped on stakes<br />
make a castle<br />
in the Sahara.  Listen<br />
the tinkling of tossed coins
 
<br /><br /> 

<p align="left">

<strong>4. And Biscuits</strong> 


<blockquote>
<p align="left">


<em>The motive for metaphor, shrinking from<br />The weight of primary noon,<br />
The A B C of being</em></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—Wallace Stevens </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">

San Bernardino High School was playing Colton in football at the Orange Bowl Stadium.  The two schools were long time rivals.  Colton was easily winning, and the frustration level was high on the other side.  As the game was ending, a crowd of students from the San Bernardino side poured out onto the field; the Colton crowd answered and both sides approached each other like 18th century lines of infantry.  They collided in the center of the field, a pure metaphor.
 
 
<p align="center">
open ended<br />
on an aging arc across<br />
someone’s long life<br />
denying aches in slow knees<br />
wrinkles under the eyes
 
 
<p align="center">
split it in two<br />
the starkness of a single<br />
unpicked apple<br />
I can’t bear so close a look<br />
my mind seeks compromise
 
 
<p align="center">
bring hyacinths<br />
the poet said, syntheses<br />
with no rough edges<br />
the poem always bestraddling<br />
one thing and its other
 
 <br /><br />

<p align="left">

<strong>5. Eucalypt</strong>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">

<em>The sky is a blue gum streaked with rose.  The trees are black.<br />
               The grackles crack their throats of bone in the smooth air.</em><br />
<em></em></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—Wallace Stevens </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">

The arc of my life had angled upwards to a Canadian bay, across the sky to France and Spain, ricocheted along the rapids where the Mohawk meets the Hudson, down and low once more, across the sky to San Francisco Bay, and ended up in the mouth of a Nuttall’s Magpie high up in a Blue Gum tree.
 
 
<p align="center">
in their searches<br />
none had ever found one<br />
Eucalyptus<br />
among the tangled Oaks<br />
blue Spruces mingling
 
 
<p align="center">
<em>l’eau du camphre</em><br />
configuring miracle<br />
cures, the body<br />
luxuriates in odors  <br />
         
flavors straight from Allah
 
 
<p align="center">
after salt waves<br />
the taste later on the skin<br />
your hands and lips<br />
in memory of surging<br />
tides, the sun red at the edge
 
<br /><br /> 

<p align="left">

<strong>6. The Dancers Turn to Dance</strong>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">

<em>In Oklahoma,<br />
Bonnie and Josie,<br />
Dressed in calico,<br />
Danced around a stump.</em><br /><br />
                  
—Wallace Stevens
 

</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">

From where they stood, reaching upwards as high as they could, rotating laterally in all directions, marking the place.  The Spanish wedding dancers circled in a ring the stoneware crock with ten-gallons of sangria, dipping their cups low as they rushed by.  Hear the music of guitars, tambourines, and castanets! The birds, and Love was in the air.
 
 
<p align="center">
eyes blank as coins<br />
worn from greedy handling<br />
feel the dancers<br />
as the air stirs, the swishing<br />
of the California twirl
 
 
<p align="center">
slipped illusions<br />
run under singing rhythms<br />
acts of genius—<br />
each last sudden <em>steradian</em><br />
of sunlight under the clouds
 
 
<p align="center">
the thing resists its<br />
own motion. The line a moving<br />
limb delineates<br />
makes a song of sweep and wind<br />
for the gods to look in and see
 
<br /><br /> 

<p align="left">

<strong>7. In Remembrance</strong>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">

<em>Only, here and there, an old sailor,<br />
Drunk and asleep in his boots,<br />
Catches Tigers<br />
In red weather.</em><br /><br />
                  
—Wallace Stevens
 

</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">

It was Christmas Eve, and I was about ten.  My brother and I had been dropped off at the shoestore where my father was working.  It was near the end of the day, and I went to the corner to buy my father’s newspaper.  This was in Long Beach, California, and the evening paper then was <em>The Long Beach Press-Telegram</em>.  As I was coming back, I dropped the paper on the sidewalk and it fell open to the Sports section which was published on green newsprint. The sight of that green newspaper is with me still—thick like the smell of spice you get standing under a pepper tree in the rain.
 
 
<p align="center">
truth of blue sky<br />
silhouettes of pines that are green<br />
miraculously<br />
when first the sun light hits them<br />
standing out so cool and clear
 
 
<p align="center">
Johnny Olszewski<br />
averaged ten yards per carry<br />
for St. Anthony’s<br />
of Long Beach.  My father talked<br />
about him endlessly
 
 
<p align="center">
on the booster seat<br />
in the hotel barber shop<br />
looking again down<br />
endless mirrored images<br />
my blond curls falling like leaves
 
<br /><br /> 

<p align="left">

<strong>8. Changes</strong>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">

<em>So bluish clouds<br />
Occurred above the empty house and the leaves<br />
Of the rhododendrons rattled their gold,<br />
As if someone lived there.</em><br /><br />
                  
—Wallace Stevens
 

</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">

On the southern Spanish coast a tourist town now lies plastered over what was once a quaint fishing village with a small, white hotel on the beach.  High-rise apartments have grown there, each with a separate pine-frond <em>lanai,</em> umbrellas and lounge chairs for the guests.  Back then, a room was $3.00 a night with breakfast, and we carried blankets from the hotel and a wicker demijohn of <em>vino tinto</em> down onto the shingle. 
 
 
<p align="center">
in an abandoned<br />
nest, the curled hairs, pieces of straw<br />
dried saliva<br />
holding tiny feathers tight<br />
the bottom cold now, lifeless
 
 
<p align="center">
on the dark street<br />
I waited in my dark car<br />
watching her house<br />
it was all dark, her room dark<br />
and I dreamed there, in darkness
 
 
<p align="center">
my dreams fell into<br />
a flower, an open flower<br />
<em>Rafflesia</em>, scent of rotting<br />
flesh for scavengers, the trick<br />
was pollinate and survive
 
 
<br /><br />
<p align="left">

<strong>9. Hjulstrom’s Curves</strong>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">

<em>There is no sound there<br />
Except of moving water<br />
Of deep and sliding water<br />
And of restless air<br />
</em><br />
                  
—Wallace Stevens
 

</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">

In a dream of cold, the smell of canvas under the tent, and the darkness of a mountain night. My brother and I spent the day hiking and fishing with our Dad; we stuck bright orange salmon eggs on little hooks and tossed them into the quick water of the creek, mad from the steepness of the hill, fast and chattering over the smooth boulders.  Later, the trout in a black iron pan on a camp fire, and chocolate milk kept cold in the icy waters.  Then the darkness, the cold darkness of the air, all night, and the smell of canvas, and the  sounds a mountain stream makes rushing over the rocks, until you fall asleep.
 
 
<p align="center">
unsounds as when<br />
a hidden closed fist listens<br />
uncolored darkness<br />
when it strains its non-eyes to see<br />
senseless under the water
 
 
<p align="center">
rock’s buoyancy<br />
propels it downward in the well<br />
displacing weight<br />
volume.  A thin red maple leaf<br />
pushes away a whisper
 
 
<p align="center">
dew collecting, runs<br />
down the skin of a brilliant<br />
orange orange<br />
as temperatures amalgamate<br />
perfectly the air’s moisture
 
 
<br /><br />
<p align="left">

<strong>10. Romancing Trees</strong>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">

<em>How he had recomposed the pines,<br />
Shifted the rocks and picked his way among clouds,<br />

For the outlook that would be right,<br />
Where he would be complete in an unexplained completion . . .</em></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—Wallace Stevens </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">


<p align="justify">

High on the cliff tops near Muir Beach north of San Francisco, we came through a hillside of Eucalyptus trees and the sea appeared, spreading out to the north and south, rising up out of itself, as if buoyed by the heavy invisible cloud of <em>cineole</em>.   I was carried to another place in an earlier time, lying under the tall windbreak where the crows cawed in the tops, and we were drunk on the smells of Blue-Gum acorns and orange blossoms.
 
 
<p align="center">
experience<br />
making a mixture of moments<br />
his thought shuffles<br />
now hard in its present, then<br />
softer when the past folds in
 
 
<p align="center">
a frequent dream<br />
houses perched above the sea<br />
<em>mélanges</em> of times<br />
where past and present folded<br />
make the pictures on a fan
 
 
<p align="center">
calculated mood<br />
swings, an emotional plan<br />
to fabricate<br />
a most desirous and delightful<br />
world,  light through a hole in the clouds
