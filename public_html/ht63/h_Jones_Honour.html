<em><strong>The  Journal  of a Siege:  1st May 17—</strong></em> 


<p align="JUSTIFY">
Written in a dank, iron casemate.  Only on a peaceful summer do these forts, so artfully conceived by Monsieur de Vauban, look their most elegant. All was prepared before the investment, now in its second month, had begun.

 
<p align="center">
Ravelins and counterscarps<br />
clad all in sweet green grass<br />
mown ready for the dead


<p align="JUSTIFY">
They have yet to bring up their siege guns; their cannon balls disturb us little.

 
<p align="center">
Dawn chorus<br />
abruptly halted<br />
by a cannonade


<p align="JUSTIFY">
The commandant assures me that as soon as matters become  seriously heroic he will feel free to negotiate an honourable surrender. And so I pen a letter to my wife regarding the spring sowing on my estate. And another to my mistress offering a little <em>badinage</em> in well-turned couplets.  The latter end in a scrawl as the earth shakes beneath me. A mine! A mine! The insistent bugle. The clatter of ammunition boots. Buckling on my sword I hasten to my post.
<p align="JUSTIFY">
Here they come, plodding up the <em>glacis</em>.  A turkey shoot, just as Monsieur de Vauban had planned.

 
<p align="center">
Across the future dead<br />
he lays his rule<br />
his fields of fire


<p align="JUSTIFY">
After the dense black smoke has cleared we see the execution our flintlocks has wrought amongst them. The living are struggling back up the counterscarp. They leave behind the grotesque dead and the screaming wounded. Poor fellows! We either work them to death at home like horses or else we enlist them to be shot at the behest of other well-mannered gentlemen.

 
<p align="center">
Clockwork soldiers<br />
lost in their own smoke<br />
they blaze at one another


<p align="JUSTIFY">
I am ordered to arrange a parlay for the recovery of the wounded, the burial of the dead and the exchange of prisoners.  With shivers down my spine, I step out with a little drummer boy and a tall serjeant bearing a white flag. Their officers are grand fellows and invite me to their mess. An excellent claret. Toasts to their king and our empress.

<em>Eau-de-Cologne</em> and powdered wigs<br />

and prisoners


<p align="JUSTIFY">
Protected by the Articles  of War I am duly returned to our lines. A calm,  clear night.  Beyond the encirclement a farm dog is howling.

 
<p align="center">
Beneath a low slung moon<br />
besiegers and besieged<br />
dream each others’ dreams

<p align="JUSTIFY">
