Four Observations from the Back Seat  

</strong></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">


<strong>1. Markings</strong> 
<p align="JUSTIFY">
Of course, I know all the reasons why this is none of my business, but I never will understand why so many people today cover themselves with tattoos; <em>disfigurement</em>, I keep thinking.

 
<p align="center">
both legs were scarred<br />
by fire when he was a child<br />
. . . his brother set it<br />
playing with matches and gasoline<br />
in a tree house in the yard
 

<p align="JUSTIFY">
From the small delicate stock butterflies and flowers on a wrist, to arms and legs covered with bold generic lightning bolts and spider webs—could the tattoo rage reflect something more sinister than just conformity or iconoclasm?
 
 
<p align="center">
some can grow hair<br />
wear pants down below their buttocks<br />
or, spiritually<br />
a beard betokening their<br />
status as true outliers  
 

<p align="JUSTIFY">
Imagine all the lawyers, doctors, managers, engineers, and professors nonchalantly showing up at their offices, arms and torsos colorfully tattooed.  Would everyone then gush, and rush up regard their voguish designer dragons, crosses, tigers and bells?
 
 
<p align="center">
conspicuous<br />
then, the exorbitant costs<br />
chilled mineral water<br />
in the waiting rooms, <em>John Varvatos</em><br />
black leather, very <em>militaire</em>
<br /><br />
<p align="JUSTIFY">
<strong>2. Out on the Street</strong>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
It defies a sympathetic understanding, though, to think he saw the world around him through the lens of his own mind.  Of course, in basic ways, he was just like you or me; he rose, dressed, went out, and came in.  But he babbled a lot, and often roared.
 
 
<p align="center">
murmuring songs<br />
that played constant in his head<br />
made him gyrate                <br />
         
slightly, when he was walking<br />
wriggle, when he sat in a chair<br />
 

<p align="JUSTIFY">
Generally, people moved around him, like a wreck, some still talkative, but many became suddenly quiet.  His eyes took it all in—the derelicts, the very prosperous, the police, the aprons of the commercial world—noting who was young and who old.
 
 
<p align="center">
ordinary<br />
people who live on the veneer<br />
    

barely able<br />
to hold on, to keep from slipping<br />
down into the abysm. 
 

<p align="JUSTIFY">
He imagined each had lived a life just like his own; had begun right enough, rose up, but now teetered on the brink; he had barely enough imagination for that.  He looked into the eyes of passersby, but they shied and looked quickly away.
 
 
<p align="center">
can’t hold him down<br />
he writes just like a writer<br />
explores too deeply<br />
words to the right sensibility<br />
implausible, they still ring true
 
 

<br /><br />
<p align="JUSTIFY">
<strong>3. No Prisoners</strong>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
When young soldiers were whistled up and out of the trenches and, slowly in a crouch, advanced across <em>no man’s land</em>, and the shells were exploding around them, and the cries of the wounded were burning in their ears . . .
 
 
<p align="center">
my rum ration<br />
fear’s libation poured before<br />
hysteria<br />
descended.  At the end of the day<br />
a drink right now, let’s have a drink
 

<p align="JUSTIFY">
. . . was it so different from life in general, once you’ve reached your middle seventies, and all around you, friends and total strangers your same age are dying with alarming regularity? 
 
 
<p align="center">
narrow passages<br />
that bump and jostle our advance<br />
an ache here, there<br />
new pains rattling in the knees<br />
light-headed when you try to stand
 

<p align="JUSTIFY">
A statistically predictable expectancy that doubtless covers both cases, a brittle anxiety increasing with every step, and it’s impossible to take a really deep breath.
 
 
<p align="center">
indomitable<br />
the way I get up every day<br />
and throw myself<br />
into the torrent of chance<br />
watching my bodily signs
 
 

<br /><br />
<p align="JUSTIFY">
<strong>4. Looking for Wallace Stevens</strong>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
I am now imagining a long rainy street in Hartford, Connecticut, with beautiful big houses all along it, not far from where Asylum Avenue bends and crosses the Hog River.
 
 
<p align="center">
pushing poems out<br />
under desperate imagined gulls<br />
naming the singers<br />
counting all the birds on the beach<br />
weaving them in with the sands
 

<p align="JUSTIFY">
It is raining, as I said, and the sky is coming down on top of us, darkening.  There is a wind coming up that blows the rain along.  No one is out walking on the street, but several cars slide past, making the sounds that tires make on wet asphalt, their wipers throwing the rain.
 
 
<p align="center">
turning inward<br />
under the eaves, now in shadow<br />
where I’m listening<br />
to Nature’s rhythms making<br />
music rain, and leaves are singing
 

<p align="JUSTIFY">
In one of these nice old houses, a banker’s house or a doctor’s, a man at a desk is writing—“It is as if we had come to an end of the imagination . . .”
 
 
<p align="center">
snowy blackbirds<br />
under sudden old snowy bushes<br />
count musically<br />
ring their changes on guitars<br />
call out over the crashing waves
