On Stanley Pelter’s <em>About Time</em> </strong></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">


<strong><em>About Time</em>, Stanley Pelter UK, George Mann Publications 2012 176 pp. ISBN 9781907640100 . The seventh collection of illustrated haibun by Stanley Pelter is available from 5 School Lane, Claypole, Newark, Lincolnshire NG23 5BQ, United Kingdom; email address: <a href="mailto:spelter23@aol.com">spelter23@aol.com</a>. The cost (which just covers postage) is £10 UK; $AU15.50; $US15.50. </strong>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
<em>About Time</em> is the seventh and final collection of a sequence of haibun volumes written over nine years, in all including 500 haibun and 200 illustrations. The seven books constitute, in Pelter's words, “an almost haibun novel” beginning with “birth” in the first volume <em>past imperfect</em>, and concluding with “zapped sounds of death's unholy silence” in <em>About Time</em>. This journey from birth to death is ambitious in scale, and stylistically unique in the haibun world.

<p align="JUSTIFY">
There's a haiku in <em>About Time</em> which offers an imprecise précis of his book. 

<blockquote>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
full of unfunny jokes<br />
impatient patient<br />
inhales sounds

</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
The words “inhales sounds” brings to mind Kodo, the Japanese art of incense appreciation. In a Kodo ceremony, participants listen to incense, that is, they inhale the meaning of it. For example, it is said of one wood: “Its smell is generally bitter, and reminds one of a warrior,” and another may be “so light and faint that one may think the smell has disappeared. It reminds one of a monk.” Pelter in this haiku, impatient with illness (Humours tang evaporates so quickly), finds the slow pleasure of thoughtful breathing. There is a fine heady eroticism in the act. 

<p align="JUSTIFY">
Perfume-wise, the base note of this book, its musk, is the grand strange joy of suffering. Oh the joy is in simply being alive. By certain fine or coarse tortures of thought, suffering can make the world exquisite. What the exquisite is, is being bared to the grand scope of small things and the intimacies of grand things. In the following haiku, the grandly pervasive wind gets intimate.

<blockquote>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
light push of warm wind<br />
inside drug fed up gardens<br />
this moth fest

</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
Fine haiku give out and give up their perfume with base note, heart note and top note rising from and sinking back in to each other. In this haiku the wind, plays the top note, its grand scale has become the intimacy of a small push. The top note beckons the poet away from the “drug fed up” musk of dying, the base note of the text. It draws our attention to the heart note, the shivery experience of “this moth fest,” moths flowering in the garden.

<p align="JUSTIFY">
Pelter's haiku are counter to the simplistic notion of being experienced in a breath. It takes several deep inhalations to allow the different aromas to get to the brain. His prose works likewise. 

<p align="JUSTIFY">
The scent of the top note in many of Pelter's haiku, and in much of his prose, is “<em>so light and faint that one may think the smell has disappeared. It reminds one of a monk.</em>” It reminds me of a secular monk, that is someone with their eroticism retuned, someone who finds the ineffable in the conjunction of objects or events far apart. Someone, somewhere wrote: Theory of Relativity?  “<em>Action at a distance happens in time.</em>”  To time stamp his haiku with the deformed notion of a haiku moment is to find a moment that is, as in “full on cremation,” a lifetime long.

<p align="JUSTIFY">
The haibun “that moment” touches on a hopeless hope for a glimmer of continuity after all the organs close shop. 
<blockquote>
<p align="JUSTIFY">pagan jerusalem psalm creases with laughter. put aside pound after pound to pay for a humanist funeral. i am i am going to enjoy it. <em>but how?</em> don’t know but will find a way. first must tell her what she needs to know. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
	full on cremation <br />
long changed foetus <br />
about to change again

</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
yours like mine is beyond that slime-covered scrawny blood-rivulet 	birth. yes it is trite but that now is of little consequence.  Anything but 	anything is better than being inside a stuck down envelope of 	darkness earth like him across our shared road.

</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
singular language<br />
under gothic clouds<br />
flames dance
	
</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
between that start this finish small bits large bits. For me for you
	there is little more than variegated traces. Perhaps it hides in a mix
	that reconstitutes new forms from old. Perhaps like a dead branch it 	still belongs—not able to ground due to support from deep green 	neighbours. Perhaps.

</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
full-on cremation<br />
strangest party ever<br />
misses a great joke

</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
“that moment” reaches for the untouchable, the unanswerable, and leaves off with “perhaps” and a “great joke,” the scent of hope, the heart note rises, and sinks back to the musk of death. Without deity, there remains the ineffable mysticism of flames, the mesmerising speculations of language: “anything but anything is better than being inside a stuck down envelope of darkness . . .”


<p align="JUSTIFY">
Pelter memorialises and sums up himself, and glimpses himself being summed up.


<blockquote>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
Our group of five comprise Jill (sculpture school), who died too 	young, Ben (painting school) of Unilever fame and fortune, 	David and Ron (both to be great 20th century painters), and 	myself (tiny school of stained glass and the better Coventry 	Cathedral windows).


</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
He worries along with the ramshackle sprawl of our language and “the interpretive collisions that give nothing away.” At times with tongue-tripping technique, he travels/explores his subject with the linguistic abandon young children delight in. With adult vocabulary of course.


<blockquote>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
	Heehaw, he must again gain rererepeat prescriptions into a 	winwinwin winter that whitens breast whiteness as his wordlings 	wedwedwed sharp colours to her paucity. Dripping wet clothes sag 	and lag as his memories into her unguent fluids run out and about 	any solid hint of him. 
His air hair maybe returns to a kinda 	translucent blackness, not that so solid raven black her 	sinsensensual fingers used to forage minutes at a time.

</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
He addresses an existence empty of metaphysics, a destiny in which even forgetting will be forgotten.

<blockquote>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
“I broke with some inherited ways of understanding, especially that of progress. Went for a pile-up of themes. Know now there is nothing. Not lines of flight into a non-existent horizon. Not even lines of vertical black. Perhaps 	death is not desire, not any experience other than its absence.”


</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
“I’ve lost you. Don’t know anything. Who in this emptiness does—or 	can? Perhaps no answer is the answer.”

</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
thick slab of black notes<br />
interpretive collisions<br />
give nothing away

</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
There are things to hold dear, to prize, after all the grim reductions. Secular moments of awe, the dizzy deeply breathed occasions when the world, in scents/sensations rising and falling away, is glimpsed as exquisite, intimate.

<blockquote>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
infinite garden<br />
sudden ascent<br />
of a spider

</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
over a cliff edge<br />
in all directions<br />
dizzy seas
