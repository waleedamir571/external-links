<p align="center">

in a room of my own<br />
listening to<br />
<em>It’s alright, ma<br />
I’m only bleeding</em><br />
singing for me
 

<p align="JUSTIFY">
I collected Dylan's records, but there are still albums I’ve never heard; he could easily do a set of songs I don't know.
 

<p align="JUSTIFY">
At the bottom of Queen Street, we follow the crowd to the venue.
 

<p align="JUSTIFY">
Tim Finn comes on as support act, he says “Hello,” then “Well, better get on with it.” His singing is high and sustained. The songs, intricate. The guitarist produces a huge array of effects; the bass player is solid <em>and</em> inventive. At the end of his set, Finn says, “I hope you get out of it what you came for.”
 
 
<p align="center">
sad not to be able<br />
to watch the tennis<br />
but they tell me<br />
one person will win<br />
and the other will lose
 

<p align="JUSTIFY">
Dylan takes the stage, stays in the background until he steps up to sing “Change My Way of Thinking.” He's in good form—this is going to be great, not the disappointment everyone predicted.
 

<p align="JUSTIFY">
After this he growls. It’s an interesting growl, but I can’t hear the words. A heavy, jangling riff drives &quot;Desolation Row.&quot; The musical ideas are fascinating, but I want the words too. A verse of “Tangled Up in Blue” passes before I realise what it is.
 

<p align="JUSTIFY">
The stage fades into darkness as each song closes; the musicians appear again when the drummer counts them in on his sticks. The band is tight, but the lead guitarist's skill is muddied by Dylan’s Hammond Organ playing (the drummer is a bit of a thrasher).
 

<p align="JUSTIFY">
My eyes wander to the bank of seats on my left, catching occasional glimpses of the crowd as the lights change. There are younger folks, but grey hairs are the majority.

 
<p align="center">
Bob sings<br />
like a man who<br />
doesn’t need to<br />
apologise<br />
any more
