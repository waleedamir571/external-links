Drawing Hands

 

</strong><br />
<span class="font12">For Owen</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
<span class="font12">When we are deeply in touch with the present moment, we can see that all our ancestors and all future generations are present in us. Seeing this, we will know what to do and what not to do—for ourselves, our ancestors, our children, and their children. </span>
</p>
<p align="center" class="font12">
—Thich Nhat Hanh</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
Come upstairs, down to great Grandma Boyle’s room. She got her smile from you and she’s always making something out of nothing—usually mischief.  Across the landing, in the room next door, great Grandad Price is teaching you five-point perspective, just as you showed him. He takes your pencil from behind his ear where you left it before you were born.

 
<p align="center">sleight of hand<br />
and rule of thumb<br />
in that armchair<br />
depth is not <br />
the only illusion

<p align="JUSTIFY">
There I am, at the boarded-up window, watching the birds that I’m still too young to name. “Swifts!” I cry, just as I always did.

 
<p align="center">sketching<br />
without making<br />
a mark . . .<br />
yesterday screams by<br />
on tomorrow’s wings

<p align="JUSTIFY">
Dad, four years old—see how he has your brother’s ears? Why not sit Dad on your knee while you draw Popeye and Mickey Mouse for him, just like he used to do for me and my sisters? Tell him how he’s going to love to go to the Saturday morning picture show.

 
<p align="center">drops<br />
of mercury . . .<br />
the slightest touch<br />
and the drawing <br />
comes alive

<p align="JUSTIFY">
Do you feel that figure brushing by? One of your favourite artists hangs a print in this distant room . . .

 
<p align="center">drawing each other<br />
on the blank page<br />
of the finished work<br />
we are what we are<br />
yet to be and always were <br><br>
