Twenty-five years later, just after the school closed, someone organized a reunion of the school’s former students and teachers. As we sat there among our own children, the topic of missing classmates came up. I realized then that, just in my own eight years at the little school, four fellow students had died. Elizabeth of brain cancer. Bobby, Jacob and Christine of leukemia.

Insects were always a problem on the farm. Flies in the barn. Grasshoppers in the fields. Not to worry. Daddy always had a sprayer filled with 2-4-D to take care of things.
