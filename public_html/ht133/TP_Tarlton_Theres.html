    Crow              <br />
                      Decided to try words.
                     <br />
                                         — Ted Hughes </p>
<p align="justify">

Around every bend on every Irish highway this April, the Sycamores and such are filled with the nests of rooks. They look to a New Englander like dark clumps of Mistletoe or the nests high in trees that squirrels make of leaves. But the rook's nests are hardier and made of branches and twigs the birds tear off and weave into roomy baskets in the tops of the trees. Where the rooks have been at work the ground will be littered with rejected twigs and branchlets. As you get closer you can see black silhouettes of birds perched in the nests or coming and going as the sky fills up with the loud cries of rooks in flight and the answering voices from the nests.
</p><p align='center'>
there beside the road<br />
they wait while passing cars loosen<br />
the roadkill-cat's flesh<br />
(rooks lack the raptor's sharp, hooked<br />
beak for tearing the meat loose)
</p><p align='center'>
sound of a gunshot<br />
and they all fly up at once<br />
hundreds of black rooks<br />
and like a cloud of coal dust<br />
they settle slowly back down
</p><p align='center'>
much has been written<br />
albeit symbolically <br />
about rooks' genesis<br />
rising black from fire. They <br />
bow on the branch with each "caw"

A-well-a bird bird bird, well-a bird is the word . . . 
                                                    <br />

<p align="justify">
The rook's beak is an extension of its skull's premaxillae** and testifies to a post-Jurassic evolution from what once was, according to some scholarly opinion, a snout. Just as appendages like arms or front feet evolved into the rook's wings, then the bird's pecking can seem isomorphic to a primate's grasping. Rooks were not in at the beginning; but they were structural, kinematic, and neurological possibilities from the very outset. They now live out their genetic standing slowly, taking time to make colonies in the crowns of trees, circling like thunder clouds darkening the sky. "Caw, Caw!"
</p><p align='center'>
we came together<br />
through the eons, rooks and us<br />
so rooks can select<br />
the right length of sticks to reach<br />
food at the end of a tube
</p><p align='center'>
they live above us<br />
always looking down. There's no<br />
rook can't build a house<br />
when rooks ride the wind like surf<br />
what do they think we're up to?
</p><p align='center'>
do they know it's us<br />
the ones killing the world<br />
leaving the poisoned<br />
garbage around, burning up <br />
the forests, blocking the sun?

                             Who’ll read the book?
                  <br />
          I, said the rook.
          <br />
                                  — James Joyce </p>

Through the big windows at the front of the rented Irish cottage on the beach you could see the wind chopping up the sea and whipping the leaves off the cabbage palms. Back across the fields, a little away from the sea, the still leafless Oaks were twisting and bowing in the wind. High up in the highest branches, where the limbs forked, rook's nests swayed and waved, the birds hanging on for life. It was then you realized that while you were inside there watching the storm through glass that was thicker than you'd thought, the rooks were out there in the raw, riding the wind. You can never really know them.
</p><p align='center'>
and that's the secret<br />
you can only imagine<br />
in the bird's dark eyes <br />
what they're thinking and feeling<br />
across the distance of wind
</p><p align='center'>
they are death on hawks<br />
and gang up to drive them off <br />
the hawk gets confused<br />
they come at him from all sides<br />
he just can't get used to it
</p><p align='center'>
but you want to be<br />
let in, to have them explain<br />
their orderly life<br />
how they can live so fully<br />
adjusting themselves to the world
