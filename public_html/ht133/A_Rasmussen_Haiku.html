 How to Read and Write Haiku</strong>
	</p>
	<p align="Center"><br /><br />
<strong>I. Introduction by Ray Rasmussen</strong><br />
	</p>
	<p align="Justify">
	 My haiku journey started about 20 years ago when I did a photographic study and website about the <a href="https://www.raysweb.net/japanesegardens/" target="_blank">Kurimoto Japanese Garden</a> near my home in Edmonton, Canada. I wanted to add Asian poetry to the website, did an Internet search, found an abundance of Asian genres, and in particular, discovered haiku.</p>
	<p align="Justify">I tried my hand at haiku, and in time succeeded in getting a few pieces published. Early on, I shifted to haibun because I wanted to write more detailed accounts of life experiences, and not just about a haiku moment. This is not meant as a pejorative, a dissing of haiku. Anything but. A good haiku can be a wonder to read and muse about.

</p>
	<p align="Justify">And the  little poem that is half of a haibun followed me along. I confess that it’s difficult for me to produce a worthy haiku, one that both stands on its own merits and that works effectively with a haibun’s prose. 

</p>
	<p align="Justify">

While difficult, and even though I call them &quot;the little pests,&quot; I'm a romantic about the haiku I most often place at the end of my prose, and I struggle over how to get it right. Consider this:
</p>
<blockquote>
 <blockquote>
  <p align="Justify">
   
   In good haibun, the prose deepens the understanding of the poetry, and the poetry gives greater energy to the prose. The relationship is like that between the moon and the earth: each makes the other more beautiful. <br />
                                                         ~  Nobuyuki Yuasa, excerpt from <em>Blithe Spirit</em>, V10, N3, Sept 2000 
   
  </p>
 </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="Justify">My understanding of haiku is that many of them are 2-phrase compositions, and like the relationship between a haibun's prose and haiku, the relationship between the two phrases of a haiku  is like a motor's spark plug, a flash of light that fires up the reader's imagination.</p>
<p align="Justify">Early on I learned that not only are haiku difficult to write, but they are also difficult to read and understand, to &quot;get the spark.&quot; Indeed, I often wondered why the editors picked the haiku featured in their journals. I simply didn't get much out of them. The problem was that I had a tendency to read them once. No spark, and on I went to the next one. </p>
<p align="Justify">I further came to understand that in order to write an effective marriage between prose and haiku, one has to gain an understanding of what makes for a worthy haiku. 
 
 How? By doing close readings of good haiku. And close readings of good haibun where prose and haiku as earth and moon. </p>
<p align="Justify">

To hone my reading skills – call them sparking abilities – I regularly peruse the &quot;Editors' Choices&quot; section of  <em>The Heron’s Nest</em>. For each issue, one editor picks three haiku and elaborates on his or her thoughts about one of them.</p>
<p align="Justify">

Here’s editor Fay Aoyagi’s first pick in <em>The Heron’s Nest</em>, Volume XX, Number 2, June 2018. </p>
<blockquote>

<p align="Justify">

A suggestion. Before you go on to the next pages which contain Fay Aoyagi’s and my musings about Robinson’s haiku, first take the time do to the following:
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p align="Justify">
  
  1.	Read Robinson’s haiku slowly several times.
 Then read it aloud several times. In short, immerse yourself in its images.</p>
 <p align="Justify">
  
  2.	Sketch out your reactions. What are your associations? What, if anything, does it bring to mind about your own experiences in life?
 </p>
</blockquote>
