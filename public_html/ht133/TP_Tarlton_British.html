  This feels like an open white sky and the archway that eventually appeared was totally unplanned. I like to think it's mirrors reflecting sunlight where the yellow showed up.

We had come to London to see the Constables at Victoria and Albert, National Gallery, and the Tate. We were staying in the Hotel Russell on Russell Square, and planning to eat out that night at Nopi's, at the little bar-seats in the back. But, first, I had to get a proper English cap. We took a cab to Bates's hat store in Princes Arcade near the corner of Bury Street. It's funny how in old cities like London, Milan, Paris, and even Dublin there are these traditional arcades and galleries of shops. You duck into a kind of tunnel lined with shops between streets. We ate a fabulous dinner in Lyons once, in a little restaurant divided in two by an arcade of shops. The drapes on the windows were brilliant red and the plastered walls a ruffled yellow. I dream sometimes about arcades and galleries, curious where they lead.
</p><p align='center'>
in a dream, arcades<br />
being drilled through everywhere<br />
clandestine, secret<br />
galleries leaving blood and <br />
furry streaks along the walls
</p><p align='center'>
it was meant to be<br />
happy! Can't you see the blue<br />
and white striped ribbons?<br />
what does it matter if it<br />
leads nowhere? It’s wide open
</p><p align='center'>
variegated<br />
tweed caps, the ones called <em>Newsboy</em><br />
you pull them down low<br />
a little more on one side<br />
it's right out of the movies

Alone in his big house, Jean des Esseintes (Huysmans's hero in <em>À rebours</em>) creates a mechanism in which (to keep it simple) piano-like keys were connected by little pipes (or something) to different flavors of liqueur so that when specific combinations of notes were played, different mixtures of liqueur came down for drinking.  So, you could drink, conceivably, Violetta's solo in Act III of <em>La Traviata</em> or Mick Jagger's <em>Under My Thumb</em>. Or imagine that the music (or the cordials) were tied to colors, like the ripe reds and yellows in the abstracted <em>Vogue</em>, the hot little ideas you get sipping, and flipping through the pages. </p><p align='center'>
if a sentence were<br />
made and the predicate was<br />
that yellow, its scrapes<br />
of rust like music frozen <br />
before that whisper of <em>Vogue</em> </p><p align='center'>
you could sing the fact<br />
of the chattering chorus<br />
of colors reaching<br />
across to make the arching<br />
bridge poem of brilliant color
</p><p align='center'>
so, then, you tell me<br />
what it means! Translate object<br />
into more objects<br />
a mere look into study<br />
tendering us your judgment

First of all, there is an arch of sorts, rendered accidentally or on purpose doesn't seem to matter, made of color fragments in all sizes and shapes, like dresses that have been tried on, rejected, and thrown across a chair. Each swatch of color is slathered on, the brush all but accidentally accounting for the shape, each yellow, red, blue-shadow, pink and gray. In turn, each swatch pulls and holds our eye for its second, but over and over the arch/non-arch lures the eye back, questioning the imagination to declare just what this is. The whole thing nervously defies the surrounding weight of white, which is the dominant color here, a white all the whiter for the persistence of the colors trying to draw our attention away.
</p><p align='center'>
abstract painting has<br />
its hand clasped firmly over<br />
our mouths, muffling<br />
gasps. It's not really an arch<br />
your brain sets off rummaging
</p><p align='center'>
for what to call it<br />
to satisfy your brain's need<br />
that it be something<br />
and right then it comes to life<br />
the painter and the viewer
</p><p align='center'>
locked in an embrace<br />
working eagerly to make<br />
the painting fit in<br />
to painting in general<br />
lean back and take a deep breath
