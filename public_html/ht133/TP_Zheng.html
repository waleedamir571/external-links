Alone Time

</strong>


</p><p align="justify">

	

When I was four years old, my grandma died and my misery began. My parents, who threw themselves into their jobs, decided to send me to a boarding kindergarten. They coaxed me to have many little friends to play with plus three meals per day. So, I went, but noticed that most parents picked up their kids daily at 5 p.m. even though it was a boarding kindergarten. I was one of the only ten who stayed for a whole week. Each evening we were grouped and dispatched to a classroom where two teachers watched us. After we played house for a couple of hours we were put to bed.

</p><p align="justify">

I asked my teacher why I couldn't go home, and she smiled, "Your mama and papa are busy with their jobs."

</p><p align="justify">

"Do they work at night?"

</p><p align="justify">

"Itâ€™s time to sleep."  She turned off the lights.

</p><p align="justify">

In the pitch-dark room, my eyes stared for a long time before I fell asleep.

after telling a tale<br />
grandma gave me<br />
a goodnight kiss<br />
her smiling eyes<br />
a soft night-light

autumn dusk<br />
I languish on the porch<br />
watching the sunset<br />
my parents whine on the phone<br />
I'd call them often
