<strong>Copy Editing &amp; Format Issues</strong> 

<br />


<br />
1. <em>Contents Page Formatting</em>: Some writers prefer not to capitalize names, titles, first words in sentences, etc. We will adhere to a writer's preferences on the page where his or her work appears, but the main contents page will have all names and titles capitalized in the normal way. 

<br />


<br />
2. <em>Copy Editing</em>: All work will be copy (not content) edited. If upon viewing their work in an issue, writers feel strongly about any copyediting changes that have been made, they can contact <a href="mailto:ray@raysweb.net?subject=CHO Sub, Name, Date">Ray Rasmussen, General Editor</a> and we will make changes that are deemed necessary. <br />


<br />
3. <em>Content Changes</em>: Once a piece has been accepted and formatted for the journal, we will not make content changes except under unusual circumstances. 

<br />


<br />
4. <em>Special Characters:</em> It is our preference not to utilize diacritics (symbols added to letters, such as macrons and accents). However, if your copy contains them and if they transfer successfully to the special computer language required for webpages, we will include them.</p>

<p align="justify">Q1: If <em>Haibun Today</em> has accepted my work, do I retain rights to republish it elsewhere?

<br />

<p align="justify">Q3: Can <em>Haibun Today</em> republish my work either electronically or in print?

<p align="justify">Q4: Can <em>Haibun Today</em> grant permission to another publisher to reprint my work?

<br />
A4: No, <em>Haibun Today</em> cannot grant permission to any other party to republish your work. Any publisher interested in reprinting your work, subsequent to its first appearance in <em>Haibun Today</em>, must contact you for permission.</p>
<p align="justify">Q5: Does <em>Haibun Today</em> presently plan to republish work that has appeared or will appear in the journal?
