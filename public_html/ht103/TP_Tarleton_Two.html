On Harland Road in Norwich, Connecticut, there was a big Victorian mansion that burned.  The fire had been in the upper floors and before they got it put out it had burned a horrible gash up through the second floor and out to the roof.  The house was abandoned, and you could see into it from the road, as if into an incision.  The fire exposed the upper floors to the wind and rain.</p><p align="center">fire is like a wolf<br />
harmless when contained. I saw<br />
wolves once in the zoo<br />
they all paced incessantly<br />
searching for holes in the fence</p><p align="center">we say, when a fire<br />
starts, that it has “broken out”<br />
a rapacious beast<br />
it will devour everything—<br />
at that point it must be killed</p><p align="center">patient buckets filled<br />
with water, hauled up and thrown<br />
while sparks and cinders<br />
soar up in the wind above<br />
the fire’s open hungry mouth</p><p align="center"></p><p align="center"><strong>II</strong></p><blockquote><p align="justify" class="font12">And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting.  And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them.</p><blockquote><blockquote><p align="justify" class="font12">		—2<em>Acts</em>, 2-3</p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><p align="justify">I built a fire in the old fireplace to help create the mood.  We were renovating an old house and I wanted to surprise Ann with an elaborate supper and drinks by the fire.  The walls were stripped back to the studs, but I had vacuumed and washed the raggedy floors, moved the fancy table out of storage, and sat down with a drink to wait for her.  I heard a loud swooshing noise and I went outside to see.  The yard was lit as brightly as if there’d been a battery of Klieg lights in the yard.  The sound I’d heard was coming from the chimney, out of the top of which a tower of red and orange fire stood, roaring like a blowtorch.</p><p align="center">the voice of prophets<br />
is not always clearly heard<br />
and choking on smoke<br />
the world burning around us<br />
—who has the time of listen?</p><p align="center">was an act of faith<br />
to think they could extinguish<br />
people wanting things<br />
drive them off their land into<br />
pens, smother each small flare-up</p><p align="center">fire’s a metaphor<br />
for love, for anger, and zeal<br />
—burning for someone . . .<br />
—getting hot under the collar . . .<br />
—or blazing with ambition</p><p align="center"></p><p align="center"><strong>III</strong></p><p align="justify">Whistler’s watercolor of a house on fire reminds me of Duchamp’s<em>Nude Descending a Staircase</em>.  Duchamp had broken the idea of a fluid movement into stages, glimpses, the way the<em>Mutoscope</em> (a coin-in-the-slot-peep-show-machine) let you watch a flapper undress.  Here, the action of the bucket-brigade is broken down functionally into its stages: a man on a ladder reaches back to take a bucket of water from someone below who is not in the picture, a man on the roof waits to take the bucket from him, further up on the roof another man holds a full bucket to pass to yet a fourth man who is tossing water into the burning hole in the roof.  A last man carries empty buckets away.</p><p align="center">not<em>a priori</em><br />
movement assumes a witness<br />
logic doesn’t know<br />
just how far a man can reach<br />
when to give him the bucket</p><p align="center">they are arranged here<br />
in a staged tragedy<br />
the chorus huddling<br />
while the banished Oedipus<br />
tip-toes furtively away</p><p align="center">this is a painting<br />
hesitating on the cusp<br />
of figuration<br />
and the abstract. So much cut<br />
from the details of the scene</p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p><p align="center"><strong><em>Après nous le déluge</em></strong>[2]</p><p align="center"><img src="TP_Tarleton2.png" width="775" height="613" alt=""/></p><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p align="justify" class="font12">I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth.</p><blockquote><blockquote>

At first, of course, the strong rain was seen as something normal, but as it went on, the worrying started.  From every quarter came the warning—floods!  Priests, weathermen, the President all urged calm, but the mouths of the rivers choked as oceans rose, houses fell into the sea, the sky darkened permanently, and mountains washed away.</p><p align="center">in a rigid form<br />
the wildest poems I’d written<br />
kept spilling over<br />
because the torrent piling up<br />
called for more and still more rain</p><p align="justify">In the dry soil of the south of France, the summer rains create sudden and violent flooding, but for just a moment.  The runoff is fierce and washes everything out of its way.  And, then, all of a sudden, the hot sun returns and the runnel changes back to sand.</p><p align="center">a place, a person<br />

We went house hunting all along the New England coast, starting up in Maine and New Hampshire.  We wanted with all our hearts to live near the sea.  On Plum Island, close by Newburyport in Massachusetts, found our dream house—a hundred yards from the beach, just behind the dunes.  We were negotiating the purchase and emailing all our friends.  We got a message back from my goddaughter, who is an environmentalist and studies the rising oceans.  She had an app that let her punch in an address anywhere in the U.S. and learn its elevation above sea level.  Our dream house was barely above water. Her email back to me simply said— “You cannot buy that house!”</p><p align="center">each wave licks away<br />
the sand, devouring the berm<br />

swallowing by grace of tides<br />
