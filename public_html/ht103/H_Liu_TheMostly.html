The (Mostly) True Story of My School Days</strong></p><p align="justify">



It was the first day of school, and I waited by the community gate, keeping an eye out for any sign of the school bus’ arrival. My mother held my hand so tightly that I felt as if I were chained to a lamppost.</p><p align="justify">“Mom, what time is it? When will the school bus come? Will Uncle Bus Driver forget to pick me up? Mother, did you tell the school . . . ,” my mother interrupted my rambling and looked me in the eye, saying, “Son, you need to be patient. Just wait for the bus. I contacted the school a month ago and made sure that they would pick you up once school starts. Don’t you want to spend more time with me now?”</p><p align="justify">“Yes, I want to be with you. But, Mom, I just don’t want to miss my first day of school. Hsing-hsing always tells me that there is a lot of fun stuff in the school. I like to play . . . ,” “Honk! Honk!” Upon hearing the arrival of the school bus, I was so eager and ready to shake off the grip of my mother’s hand and rush inside.</p><p align="center">

My mother kept nodding her head with a smile as I regaled her with my stories.</p><p align="justify">The next morning, my mother woke me and said, “It’s time for school.” I looked at her in a cheerful mood and asked, “Mother, does it happen again?” Pausing for a moment with tears welling up in the edges of her eyes, my mother replied, “Yes, you’ll have another happy day in school.”</p></td></tr></table><p align='center'><img src="#" width="750" height="2" alt="line" /></p><p align="center"><img src="../images/closure_redgold_40.jpg" width="300" height="40" alt="end" /></p><p align="center">|<a href="https://haibuntoday.thehaikufoundation.org/index103.html">contents page</a> |<a href="H_Lynch_Between.html">next haibun</a> |</p></td></tr></table></td><td width="70" valign="top" ><img src="#" width="70" height="1200" alt="koi sidebar r" /><br /><img src="#" width="70" height="1276" alt="koi sidebar r" /></td></tr></table><tr><td ><map name="Map" id="Map"><area shape="rect" coords="174,122,267,139" href="https://haibuntoday.thehaikufoundation.org/index103.html" alt="contents" /><area shape="rect" coords="454,124,536,139" href="https://haibuntoday.thehaikufoundation.org/pages/archives.html" /><area shape="rect" coords="538,124,633,140" href="https://haibuntoday.thehaikufoundation.org/pages/resources.html" /><area shape="rect" coords="635,124,753,139" href="https://haibuntoday.thehaikufoundation.org/pages/submissions.html" /><area shape="rect" coords="754,122,823,141" href="https://haibuntoday.thehaikufoundation.org/pages/search.html" /><area shape="rect" coords="270,122,450,142" href="https://haibuntoday.thehaikufoundation.org/pages/about.html" /></map></td></tr></body></html>
