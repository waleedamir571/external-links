<p align="justify">
In my mother's culture, the crow is the Cosmic Messenger, the Bringer of Justice. He plays tricks to keep us humble. In her language, a crow is called Medicine Eagle. 

<p align="justify">
I can remember one time when the crows were trying to get through to my sis, and she wasn't paying attention. She was washing clothes, and since it was a brilliant spring day, she decided to hang the wash out on the line. The crows sat in a big evergreen, clucking their dissaproval, waiting for their chance. When she went inside, they would drift down to the clothesline, and pluck all the clothespins out. Over and over, she would emerge, cursing, and shaking her fists. Fitfully, she replaced the pins only to have them plucked out as soon as she went inside. The crows stared down like the judges of a high court, ready to deliver sentencing.

<p align="justify">
The next day, she got the mammogram.
