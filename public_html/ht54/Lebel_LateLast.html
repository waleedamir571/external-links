FULL CHORUS<br />
[<em>holding bare branches above themselves, sound of thunder</em>]
<p align="center">

Such deep lakes we are—<br />
meet me at the bottom, friend,<br />
for the demons that wait there<br />
are not to be feared<br />
and look just like us
<br /><br />
[<em>the lamp on a small side table flickers on and off; HE and SHE look at it</em>]

<p align="center">

HE
<p align="justify">
. . . but why? How could you? Why did you do it?

<p align="center">

SHE
<p align="justify">
I don't know . . . exactly.

<p align="center">

HE
<p align="justify">
What do you mean you 'don't know . . . <em>exactly?</em>'

<p align="center">

SHE
<p align="justify">
How can you be sure about a thing like that? It's all so confused, muddy. How else can I put it, there's no other way to say it, damn it, it <em>just</em> happened.

<p align="center">

HE
<p align="justify">
Not if you didn't want it to . . . . Wasn't <em>I</em> enough?

<p align="center">

SHE
<p align="justify">
There you go. If I answer, either way I'm screwed. You always find a way to make it about <em>you</em>, don't you? 

<p align="center">

HE
<p align="justify">
Screwed alright. Well it is, at least, partially about <em>me</em> don't you think? How <em>did</em> it happen? How could you have <em>let</em> it happen? I'd like to know. I really would.

<p align="center">

SHE
<p align="justify">
It just <em>happened</em>, like I said. Like wind blows. Like apples fall. Like people get run over crossing a street. I don't know; it just <em>happens</em>.<br />
[<em>thunder, the lamp quits; darkness</em>]

<p align="center">

HALF CHORUS<br /><br />

Poor Holofernes—<br />
again you will have missed<br />
the sudden flash of the blade<br />
that severs you from the dream<br />
your flawed Judith takes <br />
<br /><br />
[<em>one chorister lights a candle at the word 'flash' but it's promptly blown out by another]</em> 

<p align="center">

HE
<p align="justify">
[<em>in the dark</em>]<br />
If you're not out there looking for it, it doesn't. It hasn't happened <em>to me</em>. I've got a little more respect for you than that.<br />
[<em>power is restored; the lamp flickers on, they both look at it</em>]

<p align="center">

SHE
<p align="justify">
Yeah. But I wouldn't blame <em>you</em> if it did . . . happen to you . . . if you met someone I mean . . . and <em>let</em> it happen. 

<p align="center">

HE
<p align="justify">
What's the matter with you? How can you say such a thing? It ruins everything. What have all these eleven years been about? A sham? A waste? Don't you see? It's just <em>weird</em>. Talking like this. Guiltless. Immoral. Like sybarites . . . . How did we get here? And how did you meet him anyway—online, through one of your slutty girlfriends? While you were out shopping one day and thought you'd pick up a lover along with asparagus and a gallon of skim milk?

<p align="center">

SHE
<p align="justify">
It wasn't . . . a 'him. '

<p align="center">

HE
<p align="justify">
What?<br />
[<em>blackout; sound of a door closing, a deep inhalation, then the rain</em>]

<p align="center">

HALF CHORUS<br />
[<em>thru the darkness, from stage left, speaking as in a round</em>]
<br /><br />
Duped by the grace<br />
with which she peeled her orange at breakfast<br />
how could you have known<br />
what those same lovely hands<br />
by evening would be skinning?
<p align="justify">
[<em>from stage right, flashlights under chins are switched on simultaneously, 
the Chorus speaking in perfect unison</em>]

<p align="center">

FULL CHORUS<br /><br />

Like the body<br />
that consumes itself to stay<br />
warm and alive<br />
desires merely harbored<br />
burn their ships.<br />
<p align="justify">
[<em>one by one each flashlight is extinguished until the stage is completely dark</em>] </p>
