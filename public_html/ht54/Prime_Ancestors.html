My friend and I spend the morning preparing and when he arrives the wheelbarrow is positioned beside the garden, together with spades, forks and buckets.  It all looks like a picture.  When he's finished his work in the garden, he cleans the knives and loads the flax onto his trailer.  His mother-in-law helps us make tea and spread scones with butter and homemade strawberry jam as we gossip about people we know and family connections.

The old <em>kuia</em> tells us she is related to my friend's husband as she is a descendant of Captain Gilbert Mair, a Scottish soldier who fought against her ancestors in the Maori Wars.  When fighting broke out at Tauranga in 1867, Mair volunteered. He took a leading role in campaigns against Te Kooti and was promoted to captain. Later he commanded an irregular contingent of loyalist Maori which became known as the "Arawa flying column." Mair affectionately referred to the flying column as his "forty thieves." During his military career, Mair displayed initiative and reckless courage.  He was particularly skilled in guerrilla tactics.  He had many children, several by Maori women.  She tells us their names, tracing out the constellations like a dot-to-dot puzzle.

<p align="justify">
We search through my friend's family tree which is kept in a book about Gilbert Mair, with photos of him with his various wives and children.  The lady is also related to the Frasers, a Scottish clan from Banffshire.  I've a connection with the Frasers as I've a friend from the same area who emigrated to Canada.

<p align="justify">
She promises to return one day and continue having a "chinwag" and invites us to come and visit her <em>marae</em> some time soon, where she will show us her woven <em>kete</em>, flowers, knapsacks, birds and hats.
