We got off the rattly green-and-yellow bus in front of the <em>Plaza Monumental de Toros</em> in <em>Tijuana</em> and were swept along with the crowd through the turnstiles and up into our seats on the sunny side of the arena.  "<em>Musica</em>!  <em>Musica</em>!" the crowd yelled.  The band struck up a brassy <em>pasodoble</em> and the populace roared its approval.  Someone passed a <em>bota</em> around and the wine was sharp and cool in the hot sun.  We were all impatient for the <em>corrida</em> to begin; suddenly the gate swung open and a  black bull with fierce horns ran into the middle of the arena—confused, fearful, and ferocious, he rushed this way and then that, searching for his enemy.  The crowd was deafening.  A guy in a <em>bolero</em> hat was passing a used paper-flowered <em>banderilla</em> person to person through the seats; the sharp barbed end was crusted brown with old blood and the shaft was draped with red roses.

I was doodling once in English class, I remember the topic was Richardson's <em>Clarissa</em>, and I drew a simple five-petalled flower, a kind of stylized daisy in a clay pot.  I used this drawing afterwards as a kind of personal logo.  I learned to draw it easily, in about ten strokes and a swirly thing for the shadow.  My daughter, Rosemary, admired it and always wanted to use it herself.  I drew the image of it carefully, the essence of it, and had that made into a rubber stamp; I gave it to her with much ceremony.  I still get notes signed that way.

In 1951, I lived in the little town of Rialto, near San Bernardino in Southern California.  I was thirteen, and I got a job working in the Rialto Orange Company packinghouse.  I was assigned to an electric stapling machine in a dark basement under the sorting and packing floor where I made cardboard boxes.  Oranges trucked from the groves were dumped into hoppers.  From there they tumbled onto an elaborate system of conveyor belts where the women sorted eating oranges from juicers.  They caught the most beautiful of the eating oranges, wrapped them quickly in a square of orange tissue and packed them in one of my boxes with the beautiful Spanish woman in a yellow dress with red roses on the side, and the words, <em>La Reina</em>.

As the <em>Cristoforo Colombo</em> pulled into Naples harbor, the Italians on board, returning home after 20 or 30 years working in New York, were waving frantically and happily to other Italians crowded onto the docks to welcome them.  One older man, call him Giuseppe, who had talked to us the night before in the bar and who had run a small Italian delicatessen in Queens for twenty-five years, was being met by his entire family.  They had come to Naples on the train from his hometown of <em>Cicciano</em>.  He had pushed through to the rail and was yelling in Italian and waving to people in the crowd, when he suddenly stopped and, in front of everyone, quietly dropped over dead.  Of a heart attack, someone said.
