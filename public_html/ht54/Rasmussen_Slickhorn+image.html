Here, in this remote, twisted canyon, countless generations of Anasazi lived. One thousand years ago, they faced a 100-year drought, and lost out to it. It's likely that some farmers became nomads, raiding the produce of others who had struggled on; likely there were skirmishes in which one family battled another for survival.

I rest in an alcove's shade near crumbling walls of stone and mud located high on a sandstone cliff. Ghostlike handprints are painted above the doorway. Below is the wash whose intermittent waters fed their small plot. Where corn and squash once grew, there's nothing but cactus.
<p align="justify">

I listen to the wind whispering, imagine it's them speaking of their failing crops while eating a scant evening meal. I don't know who these tears are for.

<strong>Notes:</strong>
<p align="justify">
<img src="image_ruin_handprints.jpg" alt="ruin" width="255" height="525" hspace="10" border="1" align="right" />1. This haibun was inspired by and is structured after Basho's passage, "Hiraizumi," in <em>The Narrow Road to the Deep North</em> about the demise of the Fujiwara family. The haiku "scattered pot shards . . ." uses the middle line of the well-known poem associated with the passage: "summer grasses / all that remains / of warrior's dreams," a translation by Lucien Stryk from <em>On Love and Barley: Haiku of Basho</em>, Penguin Classics, London, 1985.
<p align="justify">
2. Anasazi is the name given by the Navajos to the peoples who preceded them. They died off or scattered in a drought-induced diaspora around the year 1100 AD. The Hopi, Zuni and other present pueblo peoples of the southwest consider the survivors to be their ancestors.</p>

<p align="justify">4. The text of Basho's passage &quot;<a href="http://raysweb.net/basho_narrowroad/" target="_blank">Hiraizumi</a>.&quot;</p>
