Wyeth's dog, Nell Gwyn, lies in the moonlight on the living-room window seat in The Mill like a weary train traveller rattling past an eerie moonlit landscape.  Her head rests on a sack tied at its top, striped a faded blue.  Nell's eyes are slits—wary, almost menacing—slightly open.

<p align="justify">
The dog's dreams are nightmarish.  Through a window to the left, the moonlight is ghostly on the gristmill, like the flash from an atom bomb in the second before the shock waves hit.  Through a right-hand window, this light strikes another overflow—the shallow dam in the Brandywine River where the British crossed in the Battle of Brandywine.

<p align="center">
thinking about<br />
the story behind the painting<br />
I remember<br />
my first journey by train<br />
and the glare of searchlights

<p align="justify">
My thoughts are drawn away from the painting to a memory of my childhood in war-torn London when many children were evacuated by train to the safety of the Midlands and elsewhere.  I'm lost on the station platform and a guard gathers me in his arms and takes me to the guard's van where I'm lifted onto a pile of luggage for the journey north. I peer out of the window.  Smoke drifts past with its overpowering smell.  Passing before me is an alien landscape of fields, forests and farmland containing cows, pigs and sheep.  I fall asleep to be woken by bells and whistles and the final destination—a nightmare for a young child taken from her family to unfamiliar territory.

<p align="center">
from the station<br />
an unknown lady<br />
takes me to her home<br />
boiled eggs for tea and a box<br />
of buttons to divert me

<p align="center">
my fright deepened<br />
by a picture on the wall<br />
of Jesus<br />
gathering the children<br />
of the world to his breast
