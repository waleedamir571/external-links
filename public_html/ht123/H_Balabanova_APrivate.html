A Private Conversation
</strong>

</p>
<p align="justify">




It is around noon and there are few people on the train. A young man sits next to me and takes out his mobile phone. He calls his girlfriend and suggests they meet. She apparently refuses. He insists. I canâ€™t help overhearing the conversation. I can guess what she is saying from his words. She probably tells him she is busy. He reminds her that she has always had time for him so far. She accuses him of cheating. He mumbles something about a misunderstanding. They exchange a few more accusations and excuses. By the next stop he is already saying they had better split up. It seems she disagrees. One more stop and he again suggests breaking up. This time she agrees. "So, farewell," he says and hangs up. When the train stops again, he gets off and disappears into the crowd.
