          by           Claire Everett </strong>        
          
         </p>
         <p align="justify"><strong>Claire Everett (CE): Jeffrey,           as a preface to our interview, I want to mention how, in the inaugural issue of <em>Modern Haibun and           Tanka Prose (Summer 2009)</em>, you described, in your  editorial, how           writers and readers of  mixed prose and verse genres often  find themselves           at a crossroads where they might feel inclined to reflect on  the road that led           there and the many possible routes that lie ahead. I am hoping  this interview           will provide an opportunity for you to assist us in doing just  that. It also           struck me that the following tanka excerpted from your own  tanka prose piece &ldquo;A Record of Semimaru&rdquo; seems particularly pertinent:  </strong></p><blockquote><strong>one            comes now one goes <br />
           one             is known and one is not <br />
          all              are travelers here <br />
          merely               passersby who part <br />
          on                the road to the capital <sup>1</sup><sup></sup></strong></blockquote><p align="justify">Tanka, from the eighth century <em>Manyōshū </em>until this day, have often been elicited by other tanka.           Your poem, Claire, is an invitation to others to respond. This dialogue in           verse can engage two contemporaries or it can reach back in time and link           today&rsquo;s poet with one long dead. My tanka that you&rsquo;ve so kindly quoted is an           example of the latter conversation; it is, in fact, a variation upon Semimaru&rsquo;s           poem, preserved as #10 in the thirteenth century anthology <em>Ogura Hyakunin Isshu</em> (100 Poems 100 Poets): 


</p><blockquote>
coming            from <br />
           or             going to <br />
           the              capital <br />
           friends               and strangers <br />
           meet                and part</blockquote>
<p align="justify">Semimaru&rsquo;s theme is one of universal mutability or           transience. Acquaintances and strangers alike, on their way to or from the           capital, meet only to part. I am here today and gone tomorrow. That all is in           flux is Semimaru&rsquo;s existential certainty; one might say, in fact, that change <em>is</em> his capital. I felt a particular kinship with this tanka and with its           depiction of the material absence of any reliable or permanent center. The           stability of Semimaru&rsquo;s capital, in the end, is illusory and, in that respect,           shares the dubious character of our vain and bustling modern ones.         

</p>
         <p align="justify"><strong>CE: As           editor of <em>Haibun Today</em>, you are doing much to promote the reading           and practice of tanka prose. With journals such as <em>Lynx</em> and <em>Atlas Poetica</em> publishing           tanka prose, more and more readers and writers are being drawn to the           &ldquo;adventure and promise of a new world.&rdquo; Jeffrey, could you begin by           telling us how and when you first became interested in tanka prose? </strong>        

</p><p align="justify"> I was drawn to tanka prose initially as a a practical           matter. I wrote haibun and, in my efforts to press the prose half of that           equation closer to poetry and farther from journalism, I felt in longer           compositions that the sketchy, fragmentary nature of haiku was a liability. I           wrote tanka also. Tanka, in my view, has greater definition than haiku as a           form; it was logical, if not inevitable, to turn there for a solution.         

</p><p align="justify">My interest in tanka prose as a reader precedes this           affinity for tanka as a practising poet. I&rsquo;d studied examples of Japanese tanka           prose, particularly from the Heian Period, on various occasions in the years           preceding this—Ki no Tsurayuki&rsquo;s <em>Tosa           Diary </em>and the <em>Izumi Shikibu Diary </em>in           the Earl Miner translations; <em>Tales           of Ise</em>, the anonymous <em>An Account of a           Journey to the East</em> and Nun Abutsu&rsquo;s <em>Journal           of the Sixteenth Night Moon</em> in their Helen Craig McCullough versions. Those           few titles are a fair sampling, respectively, of tanka prose&rsquo;s incarnations as           diary, memoir, poem tale and travelogue. Tanka prose, as I was to learn subsequently,           offers much more.         

</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>CE: In           its rudimentary form, tanka prose served as a contextual frame for the           accompanying waka, taking the form of a preface (kotobagaki) or           poem tale (uta monogatari). In <em>The           Tanka Prose Anthology</em> (Modern English           Tanka Press, 2008), you describe the prose of this stage in the history of           Japanese literature as being &ldquo;rarely more than a handmaiden to the poem.&rdquo; <sup>2</sup> Perhaps you could elaborate on this and explain how these prose accompaniments           evolved over time? </strong>        

</p>
<p align="justify">A           description of early prefaces and poem tales as humble framing devices for           tanka is a fair generalization, Claire. Sophisticated exceptions to that rule,           nonetheless, can be read in the eighth century <em>Manyōshū</em>. 
</p>
<p align="justify">Many           prefaces or <em>kotobagaki</em> are entirely functional           and limited to a cursory description of the tanka&rsquo;s occasion or topic. Look at           the<em>Kokinshū</em>, <sup>3</sup> for           example, where the occasion of tanka 325&rsquo;s composition is perfunctorily           recorded as &ldquo;Composed while stopping for the night on a journey to the Nara capital&rdquo;           while tanka 257&rsquo;s occasion is a social event—&ldquo;From the poetry contest held at           the residence of Prince Koresada.&rdquo; The prefaces in the <em>Kokinshū</em>, often enough, blandly document the conventional           topic of the poem: for tanka 336, &ldquo;On plum blossoms in the snow,&rdquo; or for tanka           339, &ldquo;On the year&rsquo;s end.&rdquo;         

</p><p align="justify">Sometimes greater context is provided, as in the <em>kotobagaki </em>to tanka 589: Tsurayuki           sent this letter in the Third Month, when he heard that someone else was           visiting and writing to a woman he had known: </p>

<blockquote>
 <p align="justify">my           heart is not like
  <br /> 
  the           dew which settles on the 
  <br />  
  flowers &nbsp;&nbsp;unconcerned— <br />  each           time you bend before the
  <br /> 
  wind&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my torment increases <sup>4</sup>
  
</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">Here, the reader is provided with the season (&ldquo;Third           Month&rdquo;) and circumstance (&ldquo;someone else was visiting . . . a woman he had           known&rdquo;) that inspired Tsurayuki&rsquo;s tanka; he, furthermore, discovers that the           poet&rsquo;s theme is one of naked jealousy. This is nascent narrative, the           rudimentary elements for a tale. Even so, the primary purpose of this preface           is to explain to the reader the why-and-wherefore of the excellent poem&rsquo;s           composition.         
 
</p><p align="justify">Compare the Tsurayuki <em>kotobagaki</em> to Masaoka Shiki&rsquo;s preface to a tanka sequence written           in 1902:         

</p>
<blockquote>
 <p align="justify">Nothing is tastier than horsetails, and nothing is more delightful than           gathering them. Hekigoto, who went to Akabane Village on an excursion, brought           some back. When he told me he was going there again, a mood came over me to           make the following tanka, imagining the scene of horsetail-gathering. <sup>5</sup></p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">The ten tanka that follow Shiki&rsquo;s prose focus upon           scenes of horsetail ferns neglected in the fields, of horsetails beside           railroad tracks, of recollections of Shiki&rsquo;s pastoral youth and participation           in sessions of horsetail-gathering. These are poems of delight in a countryside           that the poet, confined to his sickbed and facing imminent death, is now barred           from visiting:</p>
<blockquote>
 <p align="justify"> those           horsetail plants<br />
  I once picked in the fields<br />
  by           my home— <br />
  this I now recall <br />
  in           an alien land <sup>6</sup>
  
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">Shiki&rsquo;s prose is richer in mood and nuance than the           preface I cited to the Tsurayuki poem. However, Shiki&rsquo;s preface does share, in           common with the examples above, the transitional declarative statement that           links prose to verse—&ldquo;a mood came over me to make the following tanka . . . .&rdquo;           Greater unity of purpose between prose and verse, of course, can be established           by the conscious suppression of these expository connectives that, in one           sense, are the trademark of much Japanese tanka prose from the <em>Manyōshū</em> to modern times, these           insistent reminders that a poem was written <em>because </em>of this circumstance or that occasion. The reader, in fact, might be left           safely to infer as much by the presence of the tanka after the prose. Modern           tanka prose in English, therefore, stubbornly eschews such explanatory links           and chooses, instead, to blend prose and tanka closely into a harmonious whole.         
 
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>CE: Following           Ki no Tsurayuki&rsquo;s <em>Tosa Diary</em> and the anonymous <em>Tales of Ise</em>,           I believe Japanese prose and waka went through an astonishing metamorphosis,           flourishing in a wide variety of new contexts, for instance diary, biography           and military chronicle? </strong></p><p align="justify">A           rough idea of the extent of this dramatic proliferation of works that combine           prose and tanka can be had by a simple enumeration of the classifications that           medieval Japanese literary scholars devised to account for its diversity: diary           (<em>nikki</em>), biography (<em>denki</em>), travelogue (<em>kiko</em>) and preface (<em>kotobagaki</em>).           A tale is a <em>monogatari </em>but           distinctions are made with respect to the kind of tale: poem (<em>uta</em>), romance (<em>tsukuri</em>), historical tale (<em>rekishi</em>)           and military chronicle (<em>gunki</em>).         

</p><p align="justify">Boundaries between the various types of early Japanese prosimetrum, or mixed           prose-plus-verse writing, are quite blurred as observed by such influential           scholars as Jin&rsquo;ichi Konishi and Earl Miner; one and the same composition may           be termed variously a tale (<em>monogatari</em>),           diary (<em>nikki</em>) or poetry collection (<em>shū</em>). The scholarly taxonomist can           distinguish further, in those writings classed as <em>nikki</em>, between the diary with dated entries and the memoir with its           freer treatment of chronology.         

</p><p align="justify">One           possible reason no single term was employed for prose-plus-tanka writings is           this: from the close of the <em>Manyō</em> period until the rise of renga, waka, our modern tanka, so dominated the           Japanese literary landscape that little else was considered worthy of the name           poetry. Critical attention, therefore, was not focused upon the verse-type           employed with prose, since this verse was invariably waka, but was directed           instead toward the narrative or expository model of the prose—tale, memoir,           history and so forth. It is only much later, with the rise of haikai no renga           and of its offspring haibun, that distinctions between verse-types become           necessary in examples of Japanese prosimetrum.         

</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>CE: What           part did Murasaki Shikibu&rsquo;s <em>Tale of Genji</em> play in the development           of tanka prose as a powerful medium that not only established context for the           poem, but served to elucidate it to the point that it was no longer subservient           to the poem and indeed, that tanka and prose were capable of reciprocal enhancement? </strong>        

</p><p align="justify">The early elevation of verse or later hegemony of           prose are two extremes of the tanka prose spectrum. Murasaki Shikibu&rsquo;s <em>Genji monogatari </em>(circa 1008), one might           argue, represents the culmination of the latter development. In <em>Genji</em>, the precise descriptions,           absorbing characters and animated style of Murasaki&rsquo;s prose threaten to reduce the accompanying tanka to the           incidental role of a lyrical aside.         

</p><p align="justify">Murasaki Shikibu, however, is not only the author of <em>Genji</em>. Richard Bowring translated and collected           under one cover both her memoir and her annotated poetry collection as <em>Murasaki Shikibu: Her Diary and Poetic           Memoirs</em>. The <em>shū </em>consists of 120           plus waka, each preceded by a <em>kotobagaki</em>,           and these prefaces range from the merely serviceable or expository sentence to           a highly poetic and suggestive wedding of prose and waka that resembles modern           English practice. Look, for example, at entry 46, an ekphrastic work on the           subject of a painting:         

</p>
<blockquote>
 <p align="justify">Two or three women had opened up a side door and were sitting there           viewing the pear blossom. Everyone else had fallen asleep, but one old woman           had her chin in her hands and was gazing intently at the scene.         
 </p>
 <p align="justify">Hidden           in the darkness         
  <br />
  Of           a spring night         
  <br />It           has no color,         
  <br />An           aged heart         
  <br />Intent           on the fragrance. <sup>7</sup>         
  
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">Murasaki&rsquo;s <em>nikki</em>,           by way of contrast, stands closer to the triumph of prose as exemplified by <em>Genji monogatari</em> than to the general           celebration of waka that is demonstrated in her <em>shū. </em>The memoir, in fact, balances lengthy prose passages of           exacting description of court costume and court ceremony with digressions that           display Murasaki&rsquo;s acute psychological insight. Where do the waka lie in all of           this? There are precious few of them (less than twenty, I believe) and they           generally function in one of two capacities, either as formal praise for           ranking members of the court or, where two waka are joined, as poetic exchanges           between court ladies or between the same ladies and their suitors.         
 
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>CE: Jeffrey,           I&rsquo;d like to talk now about the variety of forms which modern tanka prose may           take. How does the basic unit of one paragraph and one tanka differ from its           inverted form of one tanka, one paragraph? </strong>        

</p><p align="justify">When the paragraph leads, the closing tanka caps the           prose, Claire, and is the culminating point of the composition, a sign of the           work&rsquo;s fulfillment. Placement of the tanka first and paragraph last disrupts           our common expectation. In this inversion, the tanka may possess narrative or           expository qualities that we ordinarily associate with prose, whereas the           paragraph that now concludes the composition acquires, to some degree, the           climactic characteristics that we customarily ascribe to tanka. Consider, for           example, Dru Philippou&rsquo;s &ldquo;Sloughing Off&rdquo;:         
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p align="justify">what blooms         
  <br />and bones she keeps         
  <br />they are props         
  <br />that she will paint         
  <br />with her mountain 
  
  </p>
 <p align="justify">I would walk to Cerro Pedernal and see myself bounding up the           flat-topped butte in no time. At the top, where Georgia O&rsquo;Keeffe&rsquo;s ashes were           scattered, I could race along the narrow ridge with the wind&rsquo;s warm handclasp           and plunge headlong into the blue, sloughing off my skin among pink hollyhocks,           to return home as a stranger. <sup>8</sup>         
  
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">The concord of flowers and bones in the tanka, of           rejuvenation and death, has many precedents in lyrical poetry; such material,           too, is in keeping with the painting of Georgia O&rsquo;Keefe, the composition&rsquo;s           nominal inspiration. But the tanka, when all is said and done, serves as the           necessary backstory for the fantasy flight, if you will, of the paragraph it           precedes. The poetic core of Philippou&rsquo;s piece can be found in the closing           sentence, in the narrator&rsquo;s acceptance of the &ldquo;wind&rsquo;s warm handclasp&rdquo; for her           resolute descent, a leap that is meant to secure her &ldquo;return home as a           stranger.&rdquo;         
 
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>CE: With           reference to the response poems and tanka pairings exhibited in the <em>Manyōshū</em> period           and the popularity in recent years of tanka sequences in English, what distinct           features does tanka prose have over sequences? </strong>        

</p><p align="justify">The presence of prose—so pliable, so receptive to           sudden variations in tempo or style—distinguishes tanka prose from tanka           sequences. The contrast of the two modes of writing, prose and verse, is not           available to the tanka sequence by definition, and while the sequence is as           capable as tanka prose of marked shifts in pace from tanka to tanka, the           sequence cannot offer the immediate and dramatic counterpoint of prose and           verse rhythms. Tanka prose, too, often incorporates tanka sets or sequences           within its broader frame.         
</p><p align="justify">In other respects, the tanka sequence and tanka prose           have much in common. Both value understatement and ambiguity by design; both           have a penchant for episodic development, for leaping over superfluous matter           and lingering upon essential detail. Both stem from the same Japanese root, the           waka or tanka that first came to maturity in the <em>Manyōshū</em>.         

</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>CE: In           your essay &ldquo;Prose and Verse in Tandem,&rdquo; you propose that verse sequences within           prose are more prevalent in tanka prose pieces than in examples of haibun and           you attribute this less to prescribed traditions within English language tanka           and haibun circles and more to ancient Japanese tanka traditions and the very           nature of tanka itself. <sup>9</sup> Could you elaborate on this? </strong>        

</p><p align="justify">Tanka, as early as the seventh and eighth centuries,           were exchanged. Custom required that the recipient of a tanka respond in kind.           A reply often echoed the original gift by borrowing freely from its language           and imagery; such repetition drew the call and response poems together in an           act of intimate association. These poetic pairings, in the <em>Manyōshū</em> and           later imperial anthologies, illustrate tanka&rsquo;s native affinity for integration,           for the construction of sequences of two or more poems. Consider the deliberate           reiteration in this example, an exchange between the Mother of           Michitsuna, author of &ldquo;The Gossamer Journal&rdquo; (<em>Kagerō nikki</em>), and Lady Tokihime, where the &ldquo;water oats&rdquo; are the           court ladies who mutually lament their neglect by the &ldquo;reapers,&rdquo; their           husbands:         
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p align="justify">Where might be the           swamp         
  <br />in which they can put down roots—         
  <br />those water oats

<p align="justify">The           influence of tanka&rsquo;s traditions upon tanka prose can be discerned most clearly           in a reading of the Japanese <em>chōka</em>,           the long poem of the <em>Manyō</em> period. The body of the <em>chōka</em> consists of alternating           lines of five and seven syllables but, from the time of Hitomaro on, the <em>chōka</em> was completed by a <em>hanka</em>—an envoy of one, two or several tanka. <em>Hanka </em>means &ldquo;verse that repeats&rdquo; and           that is precisely what the tanka in this poetic appendix do; they recapitulate           and amplify the <em>chōka&rsquo;s</em> main motifs.           Each tanka in the envoy is related not only to the parent poem, the <em>chōka</em>,but to its siblings also. These relationships prefigure how the           individual tanka of a sequence within a larger tanka prose composition adhere           to the prose body as well as to the other members of their tanka set.         

</p><p align="justify">Yamabe no Akahito, in a <em>chōka </em>that commemorates an imperial outing, devotes fifteen verses           to a vivid depiction of an elemental seascape and the rustic seaweed-harvesters           who inhabit it. His <em>hanka</em> is composed           of two tanka that recall the sweeping tide, the &ldquo;gemlike weeds&rdquo; and a near           island:         
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p align="justify">When the tide comes in         
  <br />And the gemlike weeds on the rocks         
  <br />Of this island coast         
  <br />Hide themselves slowly in the           waves,         
  <br />Will our thoughts go after them?         
  <br /><br />When the tide pours in         
  <br />Across the flats of Waka Bay         
  <br />The seastrand vanishes,         
  <br />And the cranes with raucous cries         
  <br />Fly off to shelter in the reeds. <sup>11</sup>         
  
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">A           simple glance at the romaji transcription of the original will reveal how the           reiteration of key words closely links the main poem to the envoy and the two           tanka to one another. &ldquo;Oki tsu shima,&rdquo;           &ldquo;shio,&rdquo; &ldquo;tamamo,&rdquo; &ldquo;michi&rdquo;—they strike repeatedly with force, like the waves           against the rocks.         
 
</p><p align="justify">Contemporary tanka prose shares this propensity for           employing verses in sequence, whether at the beginning, middle or end of the           compositional design. A modern example of tanka prose that parallels the <em>chōka&rsquo;s</em> incorporation of a formal envoy           with repeated elements can be found in Michael McClintock&rsquo;s &ldquo;Before Croissants           and Coffee&rdquo;:

<p align="justify">Bread,           postman, dog and rain rebound and echo from prose to tanka, from tanka to           prose.         
 
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>CE: Again,           in &ldquo;Prose and Verse in Tandem,&rdquo; you point out the prevalence of multiple           tanka and tanka sequences within tanka prose. While journals such as <em>Modern English Tanka</em> and<em> Atlas Poetica</em> consistently published such examples of tanka prose, Jeffrey, other journals           appeared to be more reticent. It has been suggested that the inclusion of           multiple tanka was not always balanced by the &ldquo;brevity and lightness&rdquo; of the           prose. Do you think these possible criticisms are warranted and that if this           was the perception of some editors might it have limited the number           of venues receptive to tanka prose of this type? </strong>        

</p><p align="justify">The tanka and prose elements should balance           harmoniously, whether the composition offers one paragraph and one tanka or the           complexities of many tanka and many paragraphs. The demand for unity and for           subordination of the parts to the whole, however, is not a problem unique to           tanka prose; it is an aesthetic consideration, on a smaller scale, of the           single tanka and it is a concern of the sonnet and novel as well. Where this           balance is wanting, Claire, criticism is justified and I, too, am sensitive to           such shortcomings in execution or conception.         

</p><p align="justify">You alluded to the possible reservations of various           journals with respect to tanka prose. Tanka periodicals, such as <em>Eucalypt</em>, <em>Red Lights</em>, <em>Ribbons</em> and <em>Gusts</em>, are often small format,           print-only publications. The mundane practical consideration of space           limitations, in such venues, may work against an editor&rsquo;s possible acceptance           of tanka prose.         

</p>
<p align="justify">There is also the question of the novelty of this           enterprise in English-language practice. Early examples of tanka prose can be           found in the 80s and 90s but publication of the same occurred only           sporadically. Nor can it be said that much of this early writing commends           itself to today&rsquo;s reader; it demonstrates scant cognizance of tanka prose in           its classical and medieval Japanese context and therefore the English &ldquo;translation&rdquo; loses much. The existence of           tanka prose in English was virtually subterranean until its emergence upon a           firm footing in 2007; it flew &ldquo;under the radar&rdquo; and was invisible not only to           many tanka editors but to most practicing tanka poets.         

</p><p align="justify">Tanka prose, nevertheless, has an ancient provenance           within the tanka genre; it has been present, in one form or another, from the <em>Manyōshū</em> until the present. So the           appearance of newness is only that—an appearance. Tanka prose is deeply           embedded in tanka&rsquo;s history and shares its aesthetic. The tanka community,           therefore, is not without obligation to support tanka prose and neglects it           only at its own peril—squandering, thereby, a rich portion of its own           inheritance.         

</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>CE: In           your essay &ldquo;The Elements of Tanka Prose,&rdquo; the question was posed, does tanka prose suggest prose that is composed           in the &lsquo;spirit of tanka?&rsquo; <sup>13</sup> From my reading, I have seen the rich           diversity of this genre and how the number of tanka and their placement within           the piece can influence the overall character and flavour of the prose. For           example, in one of your own compositions, &ldquo;Glass Lake,&rdquo; the opening tanka takes on the role the           accompanying prose might often carry, providing a backdrop for the lyrical           prose that follows. In many of Patricia Prime&rsquo;s pieces, such as &ldquo;Wings over Water,&rdquo; we see the use of           refrain, the suppression of punctuation and the heightening of lyricism. As           tanka poetry has evolved and we have seen the adoption of more minimalist and           experimental forms, such as gogyoshi, do you think it is fair to say that the           &lsquo;spirit of tanka&rsquo; has acquired an air of &lsquo;anything goes?&rsquo; </strong></p><p align="justify">Two temptations beset tanka. The first lies in an           appeal to ossified &ldquo;tradition,&rdquo; in a misinterpretation or falsification of           tanka that aims at slavish imitation of Japanese models in subject and           form.  True tradition, it seems to           me,  can be deciphered only by serious           study of tanka literature and history, by the identification of those vital           qualities that transcend generational change as well as by an identification, on           the negative side, of capricious trends and stylistic mannerisms. The second           temptation arises from a rejection of true tradition as an impediment to           artistic freedom and the consequent abandonment of tanka form and           aesthetic—license, in other words, or the attitude that &ldquo;anything goes.&rdquo;         

</p><p align="justify">Sanford Goldstein, in his essay &ldquo;Not Again! Tanka           Strings and Sequences,&rdquo; lamented: &ldquo;The world of tanka is extending beyond its           clear definitions . . . . The tendency is to create new worlds in place of an           older, more stable order, an increasingly complex world that seems to go along           with the complications of modernity. This diffusion includes the writing of . .           . short prose pieces with tanka . . . . And so the wayward tanka world           continues.&rdquo; <sup>14</sup>         
</p><p align="justify">Now, I respect Goldstein&rsquo;s work as both tanka poet and           translator but his characterization of tanka prose as a modern &ldquo;diffusion&rdquo; of           an &ldquo;older, more stable order&rdquo; and as a reflection of &ldquo;the wayward tanka world&rdquo;           is curious, if you will forgive my understatement, and flies demonstrably in           the face of tanka&rsquo;s history. Sanford did not invent tanka prose when he           published his &ldquo;Tanka Walk&rdquo; in 1983 nor did I invent tanka prose when I           published my essay &ldquo;The Road Ahead for Tanka in English&rdquo; in 2007. Tanka prose           is as old—or nearly so—as tanka itself.         

</p><p align="justify">Look at the <em>Manyōshū </em>only. You will discover numerous examples of eighth century tanka prose           sprinkled throughout its pages. One work by Ōtomo no Tabito should be singled           out here as an example of the sophistication and artistry of this early tana           prose; it is entitled &ldquo;An Excursion to Matsura River&rdquo; and can be readily found           in translations of the <em>Manyōshū</em> by           Edwin A. Cranston, Ian Hideo Levy and the Nippon Gakujutsu Shinkokai or           Japanese Classics Translation Committee. <sup>15</sup>  I would like to encourage tanka poets and           editors to study it. Tabito&rsquo;s &ldquo;Excursion&rdquo; opens with a prose preface that           richly describes the chance meeting on the river of an elderly first-person           narrator and some provincial maidens; he is so taken by their beauty that he           inquires if they are not &ldquo;immortals,&rdquo; but they, in reply, insist that they are           nothing more than &ldquo;the daughters of fishermen.&rdquo; Allusions to classical Chinese           poetry are woven into the flirtatious repartee that completes the prose           section. Eleven tanka follow; the first eight continue the dialogue between the           narrator and young women that was initiated by the prose preface while a final           set of three tanka, in an objective voice, repeats and dwells upon the main           motifs of the composition as a whole. Prose and tanka are fully integrated by           the many variations played upon the erotic undercurrent of such images as the           delicate gem-like fish, the froth of the rapids on the rocks and the wet skirts           of the maidens.        

</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>CE: In your interview with Ray Rasmussen, &ldquo;Terra           Incognita: The World of Haibun and Tanka Prose,&rdquo; you say &ldquo;every form has           its own tradition, its own set of conventions, and with application, a form and           attendant conventions can be learned.&rdquo; <sup>16</sup> Would you say this is true           of tanka prose, Jeffrey, or is the genre still—and perhaps destined to remain—in           a state of flux?         

</strong></p><p align="justify">Tanka prose is one species of prosimetrum; it           combines, like other members of that genus, the two modes of writing, prose and           verse, but can be distinguished from its fellows by a preference for tanka as           its verse component. Tanka prose is constructed upon a building block or basic           unit—one paragraph, one tanka—and admits greater complication in structure           through compounding of either one or both of these elements. Variation in the           number and placement of tanka in relation to the prose is the prime source of           its rich formal diversity. That, in brief, is a simple definition of the <em>form</em> of tanka prose.         

</p><p align="justify">Broadly speaking, recall that our subject, like the           tanka sequence, is a member of the tanka family and therefore operates within           the traditions and conventions of that genre as adapted by the English-language           tanka community from Japanese models. Some Japanese conventions are applicable           to English practice and some are not. Some conventions, too, are victims of           history and face extinction due to changes in taste or to the natural evolution           of a literary form. A relevant example of this latter circumstance can be cited           from the historical development of tanka prose. Common to tanka prose of the           classical Japanese period is reliance upon stock explanatory phrases to signal           a transition from prose to tanka: &ldquo;Thus she composed this poem,&rdquo; &ldquo;He wrote a           letter with the following,&rdquo; or &ldquo;She replied.&rdquo;        
</p><p align="justify">Consider this extract from <em>The Tale of Saigyō </em>as translated by Meredith McKinney:         
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p align="justify">Day and night in his thatched hut he longed for the Buddha&rsquo;s coming. But           old friends who did not share his feeling came to see the cherry blossoms, and           their talk of old times disturbed his peace of mind. Annoyed, he wrote:         
 </p>
 <p align="justify">It           is         
  <br />the           one sad sin         
  <br />of           the cherry blossom         
  <br />that           people come in such crowds         
  <br />to           see it. <sup>17</sup>         
  
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">Here, &ldquo;Annoyed, he wrote&rdquo; is a pointer that directs           the reader from paragraph to tanka; one can omit this marker without any loss           to the total composition and, from the late Heian period forward, poets           increasingly do so, abandoning a convention that dominated the earlier tanka           prose of the <em>Manyōshū</em> and <em>Tales of Ise</em>. This suppression of the           transitional phrase is the norm in modern English practice. Look at Bob Lucky&rsquo;s           &ldquo;Three&rdquo;:</p>
<blockquote>
 <p align="justify">In the village the church bell intones the hour. We arrive just in time           to hear the monotonous clanging of noon noon noon noon—like a dotted line           dividing morning from the rest of the day. After a long and leisurely lunch, we           check into a <em>pensione </em>and go out to explore. The clock strikes three           three three. It isinexplicably sad, like a dirge: three three three.           Stopping in a café, we have a brandy we don&rsquo;t need, and then several espressos,           as we stare at the remainder of the afternoon.         
 </p>
 <p align="justify">around           the steeple         
  <br />the           clamor of bats         
  <br />gathering           dusk         
  <br />when           I touch you         
  <br />you           look at your watch <sup>18</sup>
  
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">Lucky&rsquo;s work, I believe, shows us how the absence           of an overt transitional phrase reflects the tendency, common to modern English           practice, of seamless integration of prose and tanka.         
 
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>CE: In &ldquo;The Road Ahead for Tanka in English,&rdquo;            you describe how early examples of tanka prose in Japanese literature saw the           waka enshrined within the prose, an approach which you called the &lsquo;lapidary           style.&rsquo; <sup>19</sup> Do you think in modern English tanka prose the tanka           should be capable of autonomy, or with the prose, should it merely serve to           contribute to the aesthetic whole? </strong>        

</p><p align="justify">I&rsquo;m not unduly concerned about prescribing rules for           either compositional element—paragraph or tanka. I strive, instead, to identify           and isolate the exemplary tanka prose work for an intimate study of how           writing&rsquo;s two modes relate to one another therein. Poetry precedes criticism           and, if rules are wanted, prudence requires us to derive our guidelines from an           empirical analysis of the best writing that the genre has to offer.         

</p><p align="justify">Descriptively, some writers begin with a pre-existing           tanka and write prose to its order; some writers compose tanka and prose in one           sitting. Some tanka, if extracted from a tanka prose work, might be capable of           a meaningful and independent existence; some tanka might not.         

</p><p align="justify">Can&rsquo;t we say much the same, however, of the individual           tanka that comprise a tanka sequence? Does the reader dwell, in reading the           same, on the excellence of one tanka alone? Or is the reader&rsquo;s attention           directed by the orchestration of several tanka working in concert toward one           end? If the reader, upon finishing the work, is satisfied by the poetic object,           is the value of the sequence diminished by a judgment that one tanka can boast           of autonomy while another remains a servant to context?         

</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>CE: In           connection with the previous question, Denis M. Garrison described the           &lsquo;dreaming room&rsquo; quality of multivalent tanka, i.e., the &ldquo;empty space inside the           poem which the reader can fill with his personal experience, from his unique           social context.&rdquo; <sup>20</sup> Jeffrey, do you think the inclusion of prose           impinges on the &lsquo;dreaming room&rsquo; quality of the tanka within a tanka prose           piece, or, conversely, does the tanka devalue the prose? </strong>        

</p>
<p align="justify">I view the contemporary example of tanka prose in           English as a complete poem in its own right and therefore do not distinguish           between <em>this</em> tanka and <em>that</em> prose. I do not set the two modes           of writing at odds. If Garrison&rsquo;s           concept of &lsquo;dreaming room&rsquo; is applicable to our subject, neither paragraph nor           tanka can lay exclusive claim to it.         

</p><p align="justify">The prose and tanka of a single composition, Claire,           mutually influence one another. Many poets write prose &ldquo;around&rdquo; a pre-existing           tanka. Once they place their tanka in its new prose context, meaning is altered           and sometimes radically. The presence of tanka, of course, conditions the prose           also, but few commentators, in my experience, have paid attention to that           circumstance.         

</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>CE: Before asking one final question,  Jeffrey, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank you for your time and patience in granting me           this interview. </strong>
         
</p><p align="justify">That&rsquo;s very gracious of you,           Claire, but the pleasure has been mine. Your question?         

</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>CE: I           have been struck by the diversity of subject matter in my reading of tanka           prose, from poignant personal accounts of family life from writers such as Bob           Lucky, to the lyrical pieces favoured by Michael McClintock, through to the           travelogues composed by writers such as Jane Reichhold and Miriam Sagan, or dramatic,           historical accounts such as your own chilling &ldquo;The Trial of Dorothy Talbye, 1638.&rdquo; There is clearly much scope           within this versatile genre. Do you envisage any limits to the possible routes           it might take?</strong>        

</p><p align="justify">I share your assessment of tanka prose, Claire, as           wide-ranging. Its boundaries, if           circumscribed at all, may coincide largely with the breadth, or lack thereof,           of the poetic imagination and skill of the form&rsquo;s practitioners. The norm in           contemporary practice, to date, has been a composition of modest length that           may be most easily characterized as an abbreviated memoir or confessional           anecdote, the crystallization of one significant event or experience in the           author&rsquo;s life. Departures from that model do not often involve expansion or           greater length but, instead, represent a shift away from a focus on the           writer&rsquo;s person in favor of a text that is engaged in literary allusion, in           ekphrasis or in what, for lack of a precise term, I might call prose poetry.         
</p><p align="justify">One noteworthy exception to this observation can be           found in the rapid development, in 2008 and 2009, of an English equivalent of           the Japanese poem tale—fictions that lie close, in origin, to folklore and           children&rsquo;s stories. An inspiration and model for these attempts can be found in           the fairytale-like qualities of the ninth century &ldquo;Tale of the Bamboo Cutter&rdquo; (<em>Taketori monogatari</em>); they also bear           traces of the Brothers Grimm and of the French tales of Charles Perrault and  Madame d&rsquo;Aulnoy. Ingrid Kunschke, in           &ldquo;Thistledown,&rdquo; personifies the wind and, in her brisk opening, establishes a           gentle, wistful tone that typifies her contribution to this recent turn in           tanka prose: 
         
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p align="justify">That           night the wind died down.         
  
 </p>
 <p align="justify">I&rsquo;ve           had enough, he said to himself. Who cares anyway? No one does. Not for me, that           is. And he lay down to sleep among the thistles at the far end of the meadow. <sup>21</sup>         
  
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">Giselle Maya, in &ldquo;Wild Boars Enchanted,&rdquo; situates the           mysterious in the commonplace activities of our daily existence:         
 
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p align="justify">As I was painting ochre pigment onto the walls of my little stone           cabanon at dusk, I heard some crackling of branches, as though someone were           coming to visit. Sometimes Madame Bosio brings me iris roots or comes with her           dog to chat a while . . . . <sup>22</sup>         
  
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">This touching, personal revelation of the poet in her           garden functions as a prelude to her discovery of a family of wild boars who,           magically possessed of the power of speech, plead for refuge. A local hunter           later catches sight of the matriarch of this boar clan, is transformed into a           boar and pleads with the poet for a kiss to reverse the charm. Such is the           world of the poem tale in tanka prose!         
 
</p><p align="justify">To look ahead, however, is often to look behind and,           in speculating about new avenues for tanka prose tomorrow, to revisit           yesterday. In Japan, there are extended histories and biographies, military           chronicles and diaries, travelogues and tales. I see no fixed barrier to the           ambition of tanka prose in English, no reason why it cannot parallel or rival           its classical ancestor in variety and in scale.
