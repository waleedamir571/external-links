          Claire Everett </b></p>
         <p><strong>Claire Everett (CE): Jeffrey,
          as a preface to our interview, I want to mention how, in the inaugural issue of <i>Modern Haibun and
          Tanka Prose (Summer 2009)</i>, you described, in your editorial, how
          writers and readers of&nbsp; mixed prose and verse genres often find themselves
          at a crossroads where they might feel inclined to reflect on the road that led
          there and the many possible routes that lie ahead. I am hoping this interview
          will provide an opportunity for you to assist us in doing just that. It also
          struck me that the following tanka excerpted from your own tanka prose piece “A Record of Semimaru”  seems particularly pertinent:&nbsp; </strong></p>

          Your poem, Claire, is an invitation to others to respond. This dialogue in
          verse can engage two contemporaries or it can reach back in time and link
          today’s poet with one long dead. My tanka that you’ve so kindly quoted is an
          example of the latter conversation; it is, in fact, a variation upon Semimaru’s
          poem, preserved as #10 in the thirteenth century anthology <i>Ogura Hyakunin Isshu</i> (100 Poems 100 Poets): </span></p>

'
lang="EN-CA" xml:lang="EN-CA">Semimaru’s theme is one of universal mutability or
          transience. Acquaintances and strangers alike, on their way to or from the
          capital, meet only to part. I am here today and gone tomorrow. That all is in
          flux is Semimaru’s existential certainty; one might say, in fact, that change <i>is</i> his capital. I felt a particular  kinship with this tanka and with its
          depiction of the material absence of any reliable or permanent center. The
          stability of Semimaru’s capital, in the end, is illusory and, in that respect,
          shares the dubious character of our vain and bustling modern ones. </span></p>
         <p align="justify"><strong>CE: As
          editor of <em>Haibun Today</em>, you are doing much to promote the reading
          and practice of tanka prose. With journals such as <em>Lynx</em> and <em>Atlas Poetica</em> publishing
          tanka prose,&nbsp;more and more readers and writers are being drawn to the
          “adventure and promise of a new world.”&nbsp;Jeffrey, could you begin by
          telling us how and when you first became interested in tanka prose? 
          
                <p align="justify">  I was drawn to tanka prose initially as a a practical
          matter. I wrote haibun and, in my efforts to press the prose half of that
          equation closer to poetry and farther from journalism, I felt in longer
          compositions that the sketchy, fragmentary nature of haiku was a liability. I
          wrote tanka also. Tanka, in my view, has greater definition than haiku as a
          form; it was logical, if not inevitable, to turn there for a solution. </span></p>
                 <p align="justify">My interest in tanka prose as a reader precedes this
          affinity for tanka as a practising poet. I’d studied examples of Japanese tanka
          prose, particularly from the Heian Period, on various occasions in the years
          preceding this—Ki no Tsurayuki’s <i>Tosa
          Diary </i>and the <i>Izumi Shikibu Diary </i>in
          the Earl Miner translations;<sup> </sup><i>Tales
          of Ise</i>, the anonymous <i>An Account of a
          Journey to the East</i> and Nun Abutsu’s <i>Journal
          of the Sixteenth Night Moon</i> in their Helen Craig McCullough versions. Those
          few titles are a fair sampling, respectively, of tanka prose’s incarnations as
          diary, memoir, poem tale and travelogue. Tanka prose, as I was to learn subsequently,
          offers much more. </span></p>
                 <p align="justify">In
          its rudimentary form, tanka prose served as a contextual frame for the
          accompanying waka, taking the form of a preface (</span></i><span
style='font-size:14px;line-height:125%;font-family:&quot;Adobe Caslon Pro&quot;,serif;
' lang="EN-CA" xml:lang="EN-CA">kotobagaki<i>) or
          poem tale (</i>uta monogatari<i>). In </i>The
          Tanka Prose Anthology<i> (Modern English
          Tanka Press, 2008), you describe the prose of this stage in the history of
          Japanese literature as being “rarely more than a handmaiden to the poem.” <sup>2</sup> Perhaps you could elaborate on this and explain how these prose accompaniments
          evolved over time? </i></span></p>
                 <p align="justify">A
          description of early prefaces and poem tales as humble framing devices for
          tanka is a fair generalization, Claire. Sophisticated exceptions to that rule,
          nonetheless, can be read in the eighth century <i>Manyōshū</i>. </span></p>
                 <p align="justify">Many
          prefaces or <i>kotobagaki</i> are entirely functional
          and limited to a cursory description of the tanka’s occasion or topic. Look at
          the </span><i>                <p align="justify">Kokinshū</span></i>,<sup>3</sup> for
          example, where the occasion of tanka 325’s composition is perfunctorily
          recorded as “Composed while stopping for the night on a journey to the Nara capital”
          while tanka 257’s occasion is a social event—“From the poetry contest held at
          the residence of Prince Koresada.” The prefaces in the </span><i>Kokinshū</span></i>, often enough, blandly document the conventional
          topic of the poem: for tanka 336, “On plum blossoms in the snow,” or for tanka
          339, “On the year’s end.” </span></p>
                 <p align="justify">Sometimes greater context is provided, as in the <i>kotobagaki </i>to tanka 589: Tsurayuki
          sent this letter in the Third Month, when he heard that someone else was
          visiting and writing to a woman he had known: </span></p>
         my
          heart is not like </span></p>
         the
          dew which settles on the </span></p>
        flowers      unconcerned— </span></p>
         each
          time you bend before the </span></p>
        wind      my torment increases <sup>4 </sup></span></p>
                 <p align="justify">Here, the reader is provided with the season (“Third
          Month”) and circumstance (“someone else was visiting . . . a woman he had
          known”) that inspired Tsurayuki’s tanka; he, furthermore, discovers that the
          poet’s theme is one of naked jealousy. This is nascent narrative, the
          rudimentary elements for a tale. Even so, the primary purpose of this preface
          is to explain to the reader the why-and-wherefore of the excellent poem’s
          composition. </span></p>
                <p align="justify">Compare the Tsurayuki <i>kotobagaki</i> to Masaoka Shiki’s preface to a tanka sequence written
          in 1902: </span></p>
    <p align="justify">Nothing is tastier than horsetails, and nothing is more delightful than
          gathering them. Hekigoto, who went to Akabane Village on an excursion, brought
          some back. When he told me he was going there again, a mood came over me to
          make the following tanka, imagining the scene of horsetail-gathering. <sup>5 </sup></span></p>
                 <p align="justify">The ten tanka that follow Shiki’s prose focus upon
          scenes of horsetail ferns neglected in the fields, of horsetails beside
          railroad tracks, of recollections of Shiki’s pastoral youth and participation
          in sessions of horsetail-gathering. These are poems of delight in a countryside
          that the poet, confined to his sickbed and facing imminent death, is now barred
          from visiting: </span></p>
         those
          horsetail plants </span></p>
         by
          my home— this
          I now recall </span></p>
         in
          an alien land <sup>6 </sup></span></p>
<p align="justify">Shiki’s prose is richer in mood and nuance than the
          preface I cited to the Tsurayuki poem. However, Shiki’s preface does share, in
          common with the examples above, the transitional declarative statement that
          links prose to verse—“a mood came over me to make the following tanka . . . .”
          Greater unity of purpose between prose and verse, of course, can be established
          by the conscious suppression of these expository connectives that, in one
          sense, are the trademark of much Japanese tanka prose from the <i>Manyōshū</i> to modern times, these
          insistent reminders that a poem was written <i>because </i>of this circumstance or that occasion. The reader, in fact, might be left
          safely to infer as much by the presence of the tanka after the prose. Modern
          tanka prose in English, therefore, stubbornly eschews such explanatory links
          and chooses, instead, to blend prose and tanka closely into a harmonious whole. </span></p>
                 <p align="justify">Following
          Ki no Tsurayuki’s Tosa Diary and the anonymous Tales of Ise,
          I believe Japanese prose and waka went through an astonishing metamorphosis,
          flourishing in a wide variety of new contexts, for instance diary, biography
          and military chronicle?
<p align="justify">A
          rough idea of the extent of this dramatic proliferation of works that combine
          prose and tanka can be had by a simple enumeration of the classifications that
          medieval Japanese literary scholars devised to account for its diversity: diary
          (<i>nikki</i>), biography (<i>denki</i>), travelogue (<i>kiko</i>) and preface (<i>kotobagaki</i>).
          A tale is a <i>monogatari </i>but
          distinctions are made with respect to the kind of tale: poem (<i>uta</i>), romance (<i>tsukuri</i>), historical tale (<i>rekishi</i>)
          and military chronicle (<i>gunki</i>). </span></p>
         <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style='text-align:justify;line-height:125%'><span
style='font-size:14px;line-height:125%;font-family:&quot;Adobe Caslon Pro&quot;,serif'>Boundaries
          between the various types of early Japanese prosimetrum, or mixed
          prose-plus-verse writing, are quite blurred as observed by such influential
          scholars as Jin’ichi Konishi and Earl Miner; one and the same composition may
          be termed variously a tale (<i>monogatari</i>),
          diary (<i>nikki</i>) or poetry collection (<i>shū</i>). The scholarly taxonomist can
          distinguish further, in those writings classed as <i>nikki</i>, between the diary with dated entries and the memoir with its
          freer treatment of chronology. </span></p>
         <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style='text-align:justify;line-height:125%'><span
style='font-size:14px;line-height:125%;font-family:&quot;Adobe Caslon Pro&quot;,serif'>One
          possible reason no single term was employed for prose-plus-tanka writings is
          this: from the close of the <i>Manyō</i> period until the rise of renga, waka, our modern tanka, so dominated the
          Japanese literary landscape that little else was considered worthy of the name
          poetry. Critical attention, therefore, was not focused upon the verse-type
          employed with prose, since this verse was invariably waka, but was directed
          instead toward the narrative or expository model of the prose—tale, memoir,
          history and so forth. It is only much later, with the rise of haikai no renga
          and of its offspring haibun, that distinctions between verse-types become
          necessary in examples of Japanese prosimetrum. </span></p>
         <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style='text-align:justify;line-height:125%'><i><span style='font-size:14px;

          of tanka prose as a powerful medium that not only established context for the
          poem, but served to elucidate it to the point that it was no longer subservient
          to the poem and indeed, that tanka and prose were capable of reciprocal enhancement? </span></i></p>

'
lang="EN-CA" xml:lang="EN-CA">The early elevation of verse or later hegemony of
          prose are two extremes of the tanka prose spectrum. Murasaki Shikibu’s <i>Genji monogatari </i>(circa 1008), one might
          argue, represents the culmination of the latter development. In <i>Genji</i>, the precise descriptions,
          absorbing characters and animated style of Murasaki’s prose threaten  to reduce the accompanying tanka to the
          incidental role of a lyrical aside. </span></p>

'
lang="EN-CA" xml:lang="EN-CA">Murasaki Shikibu, however, is not only the author of <i>Genji</i>. Richard Bowring translated and collected
          under one cover both her memoir and her annotated poetry collection as <i>Murasaki Shikibu: Her Diary and Poetic
          Memoirs</i>. The <i>shū </i>consists of 120
          plus waka, each preceded by a <i>kotobagaki</i>,
          and these prefaces range from the merely serviceable or expository sentence to
          a highly poetic and suggestive wedding of prose and waka that resembles modern
          English practice. Look, for example, at entry 46, an ekphrastic work on the
          subject of a painting: </span></p>

lang="EN-CA" xml:lang="EN-CA">Murasaki’s <i>nikki</i>,
          by way of contrast, stands closer to the triumph of prose as exemplified by <i>Genji monogatari</i> than to the general
          celebration of waka that is demonstrated in her <i>shū. </i>The memoir, in fact, balances lengthy prose passages of
          exacting description of court costume and court ceremony with digressions that
          display Murasaki’s acute psychological insight. Where do the waka lie in all of
          this? There are precious few of them (less than twenty, I believe) and they
          generally function in one of two capacities, either as formal praise for
          ranking members of the court or, where two waka are joined, as poetic exchanges
          between court ladies or between the same ladies and their suitors. </span></p>

          diversity of this genre and how the number of tanka and their placement within
          the piece can influence the overall character and flavour of the prose. For
          example, in one of your own compositions, “Glass Lake,” the opening tanka takes on the role the
          accompanying prose might often carry, providing a backdrop for the lyrical
          prose that follows. In many of Patricia Prime’s pieces, such as “Wings over Water,” we see the use of
          refrain, the suppression of punctuation and the heightening of lyricism. As
          tanka poetry has evolved and we have seen the adoption of more minimalist and
          experimental forms, such as gogyoshi, do you think it is fair to say that the
          ‘spirit of tanka’ has acquired an&nbsp;air of ‘anything goes?’ </span></i></p>

lang="EN-CA" xml:lang="EN-CA">Two temptations beset tanka. The first lies in an
          appeal to ossified “tradition,” in a misinterpretation or falsification of
          tanka that aims at slavish imitation of Japanese models in subject and
          form.  True tradition, it seems to
          me,  can be deciphered only by serious
          study of tanka literature and history, by the identification of those vital
          qualities that transcend generational change as well as by an identification, on
          the negative side, of capricious trends and stylistic mannerisms. The second
          temptation arises from a rejection of true tradition as an impediment to
          artistic freedom and the consequent abandonment of tanka form and
          aesthetic—license, in other words, or the attitude that “anything goes.” </span></p>

lang="EN-CA" xml:lang="EN-CA">Sanford Goldstein, in his essay “Not Again! Tanka
          Strings and Sequences,” lamented: “The world of tanka is extending beyond its
          clear definitions . . . . The tendency is to create new worlds in place of an
          older, more stable order, an increasingly complex world that seems to go along
          with the complications of modernity. This diffusion includes the writing of . .
          . short prose pieces with tanka . . . . And so the wayward tanka world

          translator but his characterization of tanka prose as a modern “diffusion” of
          an “older, more stable order” and as a reflection of “the wayward tanka world”
          is curious, if you will forgive my understatement, and flies demonstrably in
          the face of tanka’s history. Sanford did not invent tanka prose when he
          published his “Tanka Walk” in 1983 nor did I invent tanka prose when I
          published my essay “The Road Ahead for Tanka in English” in 2007. Tanka prose

lang="EN-CA" xml:lang="EN-CA">Look at the <i>Manyōshū </i>only. You will discover numerous examples of eighth century tanka prose
          sprinkled throughout its pages. One work by Ōtomo no Tabito should be singled
          out here as an example of the sophistication and artistry of this early tana
          prose; it is entitled “An Excursion to Matsura River” and can be readily found
          in translations of the <i>Manyōshū</i> by
          Edwin A. Cranston, Ian Hideo Levy and the Nippon Gakujutsu Shinkokai or
          Japanese Classics Translation Committee. <sup>15 </sup> I would like to encourage tanka poets and
          editors to study it. Tabito’s “Excursion” opens with a prose preface that
          richly describes the chance meeting on the river of an elderly first-person
          narrator and some provincial maidens; he is so taken by their beauty that he
          inquires if they are not “immortals,” but they, in reply, insist that they are
          nothing more than “the daughters of fishermen.” Allusions to classical Chinese
          poetry are woven into the flirtatious repartee that completes the prose
          section. Eleven tanka follow; the first eight continue the dialogue between the
          narrator and young women that was initiated by the prose preface while a final
          set of three tanka, in an objective voice, repeats and dwells upon the main
          motifs of the composition as a whole. Prose and tanka are fully integrated by
          the many variations played upon the erotic undercurrent of such images as the
          delicate gem-like fish, the froth of the rapids on the rocks and the wet skirts
          of the maidens.</span></p>

lang="EN-CA" xml:lang="EN-CA">Tanka prose is one species of prosimetrum; it
          combines, like other members of that genus, the two modes of writing, prose and
          verse, but can be distinguished from its fellows by a preference for tanka as
          its verse component. Tanka prose is constructed upon a building block or basic
          unit—one paragraph, one tanka—and admits greater complication in structure
          through compounding of either one or both of these elements. Variation in the
          number and placement of tanka in relation to the prose is the prime source of
          its rich formal diversity. That, in brief, is a simple definition of the <i>form</i> of tanka prose. </span></p>

lang="EN-CA" xml:lang="EN-CA">Broadly speaking, recall that our subject, like the
          tanka sequence, is a member of the tanka family and therefore operates within
          the traditions and conventions of that genre as adapted by the English-language
          tanka community from Japanese models. Some Japanese conventions are applicable
          to English practice and some are not. Some conventions, too, are victims of
          history and face extinction due to changes in taste or to the natural evolution
          of a literary form. A relevant example of this latter circumstance can be cited
          from the historical development of tanka prose. Common to tanka prose of the
          classical Japanese period is reliance upon stock explanatory phrases to signal
          a transition from prose to tanka: “Thus she composed this poem,” “He wrote a
          letter with the following,” or “She replied.”</span></p>

          may be most easily characterized as an abbreviated memoir or confessional

lang="EN-CA" xml:lang="EN-CA">This touching, personal revelation of the poet in her
          garden functions as a prelude to her discovery of a family of wild boars who,
          magically possessed of the power of speech, plead for refuge. A local hunter
          later catches sight of the matriarch of this boar clan, is transformed into a
          boar and pleads with the poet for a kiss to reverse the charm. Such is the
          world of the poem tale in tanka prose! </span></p>

lang="EN-CA" xml:lang="EN-CA">To look ahead, however, is often to look behind and,
          in speculating about new avenues for tanka prose tomorrow, to revisit
          yesterday. In Japan, there are extended histories and biographies, military
          chronicles and diaries, travelogues and tales. I see no fixed barrier to the
          ambition of tanka prose in English, no reason why it cannot parallel or rival
          its classical ancestor in variety and in scale. </span><br />
