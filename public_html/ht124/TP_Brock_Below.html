What right has she to privacy? She's a mother. She belongs to her children. They own her, worship her, but what do they really know?

beneath<br />
budding elms she suckles<br />
her newborn<br />
a milk-drunk stranger<br />
presses against her heart

</p><p align="justify">

Buried deep in her underwear drawer, there's a photograph of the young man she could have, perhaps should have . . . She keeps all her secrets there, out of sight, below the surface of her ordinary life. He had just enlisted when they met, so handsome in his army uniform. He put her on a pedestal, told her she was beautiful, made her feel like a queen.

At the very bottom of her underwear drawer there's a negligeeâ€”pink, the finest lawn with pintucks and hand-crocheted lace. She made it for her trousseau, when the man who became the father of her children was away fighting in the Second World War. She made it for the night and the person she thought she'd been waiting for.
