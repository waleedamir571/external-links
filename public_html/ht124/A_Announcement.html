<p align="Center"><strong>Welcome to Our New Tanka Prose Editors, Tish Davis &amp; Tim Gardiner<br /> &amp; <br />
 Many Thanks to Our Retiring Editor, Janet Lynn Davis</strong></p>
<p align="justify">

Janet Lynn Davis has served as our Tanka Prose editor since December 2016. The task of editing is a challenging job. We are all amateurs in the sense that we started our excursions into the haiku and tanka genres by writing and having our work published. If you're like me, you've mostly taken  editors for granted, or at least didn't think much about how challenging it is to walk in their shoes. At some point, Janet and her predecessors in our Tanka Prose section, Jeffrey Woodward and Claire Everett, decided to volunteer, spending a significant amount of their time contributing to our writing community, and particularly in developing our Tanka Prose section. Thank you, Janet, for making this vibrant section possible. I know that I speak for all of our editorial staff when I mention that Janet has been outstanding on all aspects of putting out our issues. She's been especially active proofreading and making suggestions for the improvement of <em>Haibun Today</em>. She's also been instrumental in maintaining our connection with the small, active community of tanka prose poets. And, she's become a colleague who I will miss. </p>
<p align="justify">We welcome  Tish Davis and Dr. Tim Gardiner to our Tanka Prose editorial ranks. Tish will edit the March and September issues, coming on board with the release of this issue on December 1. Tim will edit for our June and December issues.</p>
<p align="justify">Tish currently lives in the snowbelt in northern Ohio. In 2005,  she discovered haibun and was later encouraged by Jeffrey Woodward to write tanka prose. Her awards and honors and some of her haiku are listed in the <a href="https://www.thehaikufoundation.org/poet-details/?IDclient=222" target="_blank">Haiku Foundation's Haiku Registry</a> and include a Pushcart Nomination for her haibun in <em>Modern Haiku</em> 40:3, 2009. Her haibun pieces have appeared in numerous journals and her tanka prose in <em>Atlas Poetica</em>, <em>Skylark</em>, <em>Modern Haibun and Tanka Prose</em> and <em>Haibun Today</em>.</p>
