This drawing might have been by Leonardo da Vinci—the circles, the colors, the faded writing—and when I looked through a collection of Leonardo's drawings, I came upon the map of Imola* that he had drawn for Cesare Borgia and which led Borgia to employ him making strategic maps and drawings. Now, I know a little about Cesare Borgia (I was at one time a Machiavelli scholar) and the way his genius and dexterity carried him only so far; in the end he fizzled out. The <em>Ralph Jester House</em> was never built, but many years later Bruce Pfeiffer, archivist of the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation, built a house based on Wright's original plans on Wright Foundation land near Taliesin West. Circles, as the saying goes, within circles. </p><p align='center'>

you could never say<br />
straight away and for certain<br />
what this drawing showed<br />
an old clock's inner workings<br />
or his dream of the cosmos

caught in geometry's throes<br />

to the pure Ideal <br />

 This could be a picture of a house on a hillock with trees, but the elevation seems to have descended to earth out of the spherical heavens above it. In the heavens, the nested spheres of the universe almost hover over the rectangular arrangement of the house, like eagles over eaglets in their eyrie, imparting sustenance and bespeaking figuration. All this announces an idea of harmonics, how the one—thing, sound, mood, focus, and number—fits and echoes off the others, makes of certain observations their concentric spheres. From there, from the magic and the edges of the circle, we measure distances and relations to the end of our familiarity.

There are 24 hours in a mean solar day, 60 minutes in each hour, and 60 seconds in each minute. The question shifting among the abstractions is—what exactly is a second? Well you make a gear wheel that contains 360 teeth, and connect it to a tension source such that the wheel moves one notch each time the sun comes round again. When that wheel moves it sets in motion another gear with twenty-four notches that, in turn, moves another of sixty notches and that still another of sixty notches. Am I babbling do you think? I'll try again. The earth turns 360° in that mean solar day, that's 15° per hour, 
0.25° per minute or .0041666...° per second. And that same practical question comes up again—what is a second? The time it takes a person standing on the equator to travel .287 miles in the rotation of the earth. Lay out lines and circles, the lines and circles of a clock, or watch the shadows of the sundial, and as they move or make a clicking sound, well, those are the ratchets and their click is where the pillars of the frame bridge between wheels and springs. There were two wheels in John Harrison's <em>sea clock</em> that carried one second's click to the escapement.**
