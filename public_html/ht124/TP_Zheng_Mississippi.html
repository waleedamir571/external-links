1.     Relocation</p>
<p align="justify">

On September 15, 1963, Louisa, a white lady whose husband managed Mississippi John Hurt's recordings, and Rosalee, who was Louisa's home help, drove John's wife, Jessie, and their two grandchildren out of Avalon, Mississippi. The plan was to join John in D.C. And Avalon, through John’s soft eyes, had been an asshole of the world.

<blockquote>
 <p align="justify">
  
  yin and yang<br />
  a duality<br />
  of oneness<br />
        night and day<br />
        balancing black and white
  
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">
 
 They headed north to Memphis, wishing to avoid Alabama on their journey, because a local in Birmingham told them that white and black women were not allowed to travel in the same vehicle. 
 
 
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p align="justify">
  southern dusk<br />
  storm clouds gathering<br />
  over cotton fields<br />
        after the thunder<br />
        a bright moon
  
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">

That same day in Birmingham, four little black girls attending Sunday school were killed by a bomb attack.
 

</p>
<blockquote>
 <p align="justify">
  in an evening sky<br />
  rapid movements<br />
  of gray clouds<br />
        now a clan of lions<br />
        now a shiver of sharks
  
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">

John's wife and their grandkids managed to arrive safely in D.C., then John reunited with them after his performance tour. The Hurts moved into an apartment that was clean and roomy, but their neighborhood was infested with drugs, rapes, murders, and robberies. Unable to feel at home, they pined for the asshole of Mississippi. 

</p>
<blockquote>
 <p align="justify">
  
  life is life<br />
  part daydream<br />
  part nightmare<br />
        in a dim bar<br />
        a man strums his guitar
  
  
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">
 
2.     Memento</p><p align="justify">
 
Mississippi John Hurt used to cut crossties with his axe for the railroad back in Avalon. That axe had been his old friend. Without it beside him any longer, his new life in the crime-ridden inner city of D.C. became filled with anxiety.

</p>
<blockquote>
 <p align="justify">
  
  summer night<br />
  the sirens grow louder<br />
  and louder<br />
        he looks out at the street<br />
        strangely quiet now
  
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">

When someone shipped the axe to him, John treated it as a reminder of his past experience in Mississippi. With the axe in his hands, he felt a sense of fulfillment even though he could not regain the energy to split logs for firewood. 

</p>
<blockquote>
 <p align="justify">
  
  in the dark<br />
  the couple reminisces<br />
  about the old days<br />
        chirping crickets<br />
        sparkling stars
