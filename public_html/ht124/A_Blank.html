<p align="Center"><strong>Welcome to our new Tanka Prose Editors <br /> &amp; <br />
 Many thanks to retiring editor, Janet Lynn Davis</strong></p>
<p align="justify">

Janet Lynn Davis has served as our Tanka Prose editor since our March 2011 issue. The task of editing is a challenging job. We are all amateurs in the sense that we started our excursion into the haiku genres by writing and hoping to have published our own work. If you're like me, you mostly took the editors for granted. At some point, Janet, and her predecessors in our Tanka Prose section, Jeffrey Woodward and Clare Everett, decided to volunteer to spend a significant amount of their time contributing to our writing community. Thank you, Janet, Clare and Jeffrey for making this vibrant Tanka Prose section possible. </p>
<p align="justify">And welcome Tish Davis and Dr. Tim Gardiner to our editorial ranks. Tish will edit the March and September issues (she'll come onboard with the release of this issue on December 1; Tim will edit our June and December issues. Here are some thing you might like to know about them if you've not yet read their own published work.</p>
<p align="justify">Tish currently lives in the snowbelt in Northern Ohio. In 2005, while experimenting with brevity, she discovered multiple haiku that didn't follow the "rules." She also discovered haibun. Her awards and honors are listed in the Haiku Registry and include a Pushcart Nomination for her haibun in <em>Modern Haiku</em> 40.3 (2009). Tish was introduced to tanka prose late in 2007 via Jeffrey Woodward and <em>Haibun Today</em>. Her tanka prose pieces have appeared in <em>Haibun Today</em>, <em>Atlas Poetica</em>, <em>Skylark</em>, and <em>Modern Haibun and Tanka Prose</em>. Here are two examples of Tish's work:

Tarlton, "Toward a Theory and Practice of Tanka-Prose," <em>Haibun Today</em> 5:4, December 2011. </a></li>
</ul>
<p align="justify">Dr. Tim Gardiner is an ecologist, poet, and childrenâ€™s author from Manningtree in Essex, UK. He has had over 1,000 poems published in the last decade and has won two poetry competitions. Tim's tanka prose has been published in leading print and online journals, including <em>Haibun Today</em> and <em>Skylark</em>, and he has been widely anthologised. His first collection of poetry, <em>Wilderness</em>, was published by Brambleby Books in 2015, and a second haiku collection, <em>On the Edge</em>, appearing in 2017. Tim's latest haibun collection, <em>The Flintknapper's Ghost</em>, was released by Alba Publishing in 2018. Here are two examples of Tim's work: </p>
