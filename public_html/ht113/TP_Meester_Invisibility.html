As I undress for the venous ultrasound, I wonder if the radiology tech is terse with me because she recognizes my name—connects it with the doctor, with our divorce, with my new status as castoff, with some rumor that may be circulating her work area.


</p><p align='center'>leaning<br />
 against the back door<br />
I fall into his house<br />
not even my shadow<br />
feels welcome here

</p><p align="justify">Once the tests are finished, before my release, I pace the waiting area. There he is: walking briskly right past me, dressed in the blue cashmere coat and scarf I picked out for him. A tall, slender blonde with her hair loosely piled upon her head, hands animated in conversation, is at his side.


</p><p align='center'>the corners<br />
of his lips curl,<br />
his head tilts down . . .<br />
this shy schoolboy,<br />
my husband of 35 years

</p><p align="justify">He doesn't notice me. He doesn't recognize my scent, although he should, having passed so close. A part of me wants to call out to him, tell him to pick up dinner for us; or hey, let's catch a movie.


</p><p align='center'>grasping my keys<br />
as I would a dagger<br />
I discover his car<br />
parked close to mine—<br />
same model, different colors

</p><p align="justify">Back home I open a note. In it, he explains that the offer he made to duplicate our photo albums, a set for each of us and our children, "is no longer reasonable." 


</p><p align='center'>as if he's a man<br />
who keeps his agreements<br />
he returns<br />
our family memories<br />
in plastic containers

</p><p align="justify">The years we shared spin around me as if they are happening now. My first impression of him in that college botany class, when I knew "this man will be trouble," and how I immediately fell in love with him. My decision after our wedding to give up a scholarship for advanced education—so I could support the two of us during his years of medical training. I have vivid recall of each birth, the bright colors of celebrations and Caribbean vacations, the joy of graduations, and the happy sorrows when our children moved on into their own lives. My head fills with the moments lost when my husband put his practice before us. Regrettably, I misunderstood his language of jewelry and flowers.


</p><p align='center'>parting, he says<br />
 <em>I never got your poetry</em><br />
I whisper<br />
<em>that's because it was<br />
all about you 

</em></p><p align="justify">After 18 months of divorce, he writes that he can no longer honor our financial agreement. I picture him pondering this action, wearing a face of concern, slumping his shoulders for the shame of it.


</p><p align='center'>silent autumn morning—<br />
while I record dreams<br />
a hawk's flight <br />
catches my eye, reminds me<br />
you were just passing through
