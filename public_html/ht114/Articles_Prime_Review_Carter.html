A Review of Steven Carter's <em>Honey of Generation: Haibun & Tanka Prose</em>
</strong>

</p>
<p align="justify">

  <strong>Steven Carter, <em>Honey of Generation: Haibun & Tanka Prose</em>, <a href="http://www.albapublishing.com/" target="_blank">Alba Publishing</a>,  Uxbridge: United Kingdom, 2017. Paperback, 78 pp. ISBN: 978-1-910185-81-0. US$10 / UK £8 / E10. </strong></p><p align="justify"><img src="Articles_Prime_Review_Carter.png" width="168" height="239" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10" alt=""/>Steven Carter is a major presence in both poetry and prose. While he has constantly experimented with a pushed the boundaries of form and influence in his writing, his work returns often to key themes and ideas, preoccupations and effects that this collection throws into brilliant relief: a politics of language, social and natural relationships, how memory works, the perceptual world.
	</p><p align="justify">A father and grandfather, his haibun and tanka prose are not likely to feature more domestic issues. But the far-ranging, tenacious, conceptual, romantic poet, with his rich and intellectually rigorous voice, is the same, and tracing that voice through his poetry is one of the pleasures readers will take from this book.
</p><p align="justify">	Several of the poems have been written about the passing of time and it’s good that they can make sense of some of Carter’s traumatic experiences. In the first four-part poem “Elegies, for example, he writes about a girl he first met in a group home. He opens the tanka prose with these words:

</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="justify">After her mother killed herself by jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge, Annie’s father pulled her from the group home. I never saw her again.
    
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">The language reverberates with the orderly sequence of time passing, the trustworthiness of memory and especially the self as centred meaning-maker.
	</p><p align="justify">What’s interesting about the poem “Journey” may be the way it recalls the lost Anasazi:

</p>
	<blockquote>
	  <p align="justify">		Anasazi = A Navajo word meaning The Ancient Ones.
	    </p>
	  <p align="justify">Even the Navajo hadn’t a clue as to what happened to them. They just took off for parts unknown, hoping to catch up with the life-giving monsoon moisture which forsook them.
	    
	    </p>
	  </blockquote>
	<p align="justify">The poem recalls the Anasazi’s history and gets to the point lucidly.
</p><p align="justify">	But more often what’s enjoyable is when a poem veers off, carried along by momentum, towards a destination the reader may not be anticipating. Such a poem is “In the Crowd”, where a girl is seen walking ahead of the poet. Someone he never met “. . . never saw her face, but what remains in my fevered memory is the turn of a shapely ankle as she climbs the hotel steps and disappears through the tall entrance.” The poem ends

</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="justify">But all these tableaux and more are stitched together by the delicate curve of her high-heeled ankle, the sun low on the horizon, a day moon, and the toss of her hair. And inevitably: all my losses before and since.
    
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">The closing sentence gives us the sense, not only of inevitability, but the sadness of lost opportunities.
</p><p align="justify">	I enjoy the way Carter’s language ca be our co-conspirator in subverting the too-predictable meeting of the sign with its meaning or referent – can encourage or scepticism. It’s interesting to follow his thoughts and language that keeps on eluding a conclusion, such as we see in “1981”. Here, thirty years have passed, and the poet recalls something he can’t believe happened. As he sits on the end of the dock, sipping a beer, the weather makes a sudden change and a forty-foot high wall of cloud moves towards him: “Too mesmerised to move, I watch the water change from blue, to green, to gray, to black.”
	</p><p align="justify">Poetry makes a different kind of meaning to our recollections and memories. The differences are opened in Carter’s writing and multiplied by the passage of time. In “Labor Day”, he paints a picture of a lady who runs a campground and is filling a bag with ice:

</p>
	<blockquote>
	  <p align="justify">In the eyes of the world she doesn’t have a lot going for her – to some, zilch. Overweight, squatty, she’s also cursed with a grating, irritating voice and lank, stringy hair.
	    
	    </p>
	  </blockquote>
	<p align="justify">In the title poem “Honey of Generation”, Carter recalls his paternal grandfather “who hailed from Kentucky and participated in the mid- to 19th-century family feuds.” “Poem beginning with an improvisation on Basho”, is quite a different type of poem, as the poet recalls the beauty of the women he’s loved:

</p>
	<blockquote>
	  <p align="justify">Not long ago I spent an entire Sunday morning thinking of the women I’ve loved – all of them different: different looks, personalities backgrounds. Two of them shared the same first name; other than that –
	    
	    </p>
	  <p align="center">					blue blur –<br />
	    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bluebird or<br />
	    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;patch of sky </p>
