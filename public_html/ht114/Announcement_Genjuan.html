GENJUAN International Haibun Contest 
</strong>


</p><p align="justify">

Genjuan is the name of the cottage near Lake Biwa where, in 1690, Basho lived for a time. His residence in this ‘Vision-Inhabited Cottage’ was probably the happiest period of his life, and it was there that he wrote his most famous short haibun. The purpose of the Contest is to encourage the writing of fine haibun in English and maintain the connection between the traditional Japanese perception of haibun and what is evolving around the world. The judges are hoping that the Contest will continue to receive a warm response from all haibun writers. The award for the Grand Prix remains the same – a fine, full-size replica of a Hokusai or Hiroshige ukiyo-e print – and smaller gifts will be sent to the An (Cottage) Prize-winners. The writers of all the decorated works will receive a certificate of merit. We sincerely look forward to your participation.

  <strong>Guidelines for 2018</strong> </p><p align="justify">
1 Subject:                  Free.


</p><p align="justify">
2 Style:                      No restrictions, but special attention must be paid to honour the spirit of haikai. This includes such features as the subtle linking of haiku with prose, omission prompting the reader’s imagination, humour and self-deprecation.


</p><p align="justify">
3 Length:                   In total, between 7 and 35 lines (at 1 line = 80 spaces; a 3-line haiku counts as 3 lines; the title, as 1 line).


</p><p align="justify">
4 Haiku/Title:            At least one haiku (no formal restrictions) should be included and each piece should be given a title, however short.


</p><p align="justify">
5 Format:                   Print each piece separately on one sheet of A4-size paper (and use the reverse if long) and write at the bottom your name (and your pen name, if you have one) together with your address, telephone number, and email address. Your privacy will be strictly protected, and the judges will not see your names until the result has been decided.


</p><p align="justify">
6 Deadline:               All entries should reach the following address between 1 October 2017 and 31 January 2018. Please send your entries to: Ms. Eiko Mori, 2-11-23-206 Jokoji, Amagasaki-she, Hyogo-ken 660-0811, Japan. Entries received after this date might not be accepted. Kindly avoid sending by express and using extra-large envelopes. Best write your home address on your envelope, too. We apologize for not being able to accept emailed entries.


</p><p align="justify">
7 Entry Fee:              None.


</p><p align="justify">
8 Restrictions:          Entrants can send up to three entries, but two is what we normally expect. They should be unpublished and not under consideration elsewhere. As we cannot return your entries after screening, please retain your own copies.


</p><p align="justify">
9 Questions:             All queries should be sent to the address above or by email to moriemori55@yahoo.co.jp  Email Ms. Mori 2 weeks after sending your entries if you wish to have an acknowledgement of receipt.


</p><p align="justify">
10 Judges:                 Neaten Setouchi (emeritus), Stephen Henry Gill (Tito), Hisashi Miyazaki, Angelee Deodhar (newly appointed)


</p><p align="justify">
11 Special Request:  The authors of the decorated works will later be requested to send us their pieces as Word-files by email. In this, we expect your cooperation.


</p><p align="justify">
12 Results:                 The results will be posted on the Hailstone Icebox by May after awardees have first been notified by email. Later, the prize-winning pieces will be posted there on a dedicated page. Judges’ comments will, in due course, be sent to awardees, together with prizes and/or certificates of merit.
