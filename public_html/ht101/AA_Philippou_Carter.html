On Terry Ann Carter’s<em>On the Road to Naropa</em></strong></p><p align="justify"><strong><em>On the Road to Naropa, My Love Affair with Jack Kerouac: A Haibun Memoir</em> by Terry Ann Carter. Edmonton, AB, Canada: Inkling Press, 2015. Paperback, 77pp. ISBN 978-1928147-24-4. Price: $15 CAD.</strong><p align="justify">
Terry Ann Carter, president of Haiku Canada, is the author of four collections of lyric poetry and five haiku chapbooks. Her current publication,<em>On the Road to Naropa, My Love Affair with Jack Kerouac: A Haibun Memoir</em>, is her first foray into this form. Interspersed with the life and writings of Jack Kerouac, it is told in episodic mode. Some of the major recurring themes are her missing brother, husband’s illness and mother’s death.<p align="justify">
Forty-three haibun, titled by year, range from 1946 to 2013. The majority of them follow the standard format of one paragraph and one haiku. Four tanka sequences are also included. With the exception of the last haibun of this review, all works are quoted in full.<p align="justify">
Carter often layers her family memories with flash-forward techniques as in “1948”:<blockquote><p align="justify">
    I stay with my aunt and uncle who live on Cape Cod when the 	eldest of my brothers is born. Their home looks onto the ocean. I 	only remember stories that are told about this visit. The way I 	watched my aunt painting the Manhattan skyline over their bar. 	The way I would remember this drawing in 2001 when the Twin 	Towers burned to the ground. The way my brother’s life would 	spiral out of control and fall into ashes.</p><p align="justify">
    into the air and gone<br />
    the scent of wild roses<br />
    and rain</p></blockquote><p align="justify">
The poetic device anaphora with accent on the phrase “the way” helps to bring the reader into the emotionality of the piece. The fleeting nature of life that is expressed in the prose reverberates nicely in the haiku.<p align="justify">
In many haibun, Carter effortlessly blends personal experiences with elements of American popular culture. Consider “1952”:<blockquote><p align="justify">
    A second brother is born in Waterbury, Connecticut, the hometown of 	Rosalind Russell. I watch her buy gloves at Bonwit Teller’s on a 	shopping spree with my mother who wants me to wear organdy 	dresses. And patent leather shoes. Second brother never likes 	Rosalind Russell, prefers Gene Autry. In kindergarten I learn how to 	read. I would rather freeze my legs off than wear snow pants.</p><p align="justify">
    all the little fingers<br />
    in the puzzle—<br />
    recess bell</p></blockquote><p align="justify">
The final prose sentence, a clever turn of phrase, reveals a six-year-old’s growing awareness of appearance. The haiku seems like a missed opportunity, merely relating back to children in the prose.<p align="justify">
Oftentimes, the relationship between prose and haiku is weak. Take, for instance, “1956”:<blockquote><p align="justify"><em>Father Knows Best</em>. Mathematician, gardener, southern gentleman, 	scholar. When I am ten he builds a hutch for my rabbit, Mittens. And 	a model of the Panama Canal in the back yard. With 	locks that lift for 	toy boats to sail through. He sprays the garden hose against my bare 	legs. A million tiny droplets form a crystal arc against the sun.</p><p align="justify">
    circus tents<br />
    enough<br />
    just to hold his hand</p><p align="justify">
    I didn’t know that my older son would live and work in Panama 	City. 	That I would travel there to see the real canal.</p><p align="justify">
    waiting for toucans<br />
    jacaranda petals<br />
    fall one by one</p></blockquote><p align="justify">
The first haiku seems to recall another childhood memory and is therefore too close to the prose. The second haiku contains lovely images but it is uncertain what the writer is attempting to evoke.<p align="justify">
In the haibun “1962” the prose moves skillfully from a global to a local scene, from “missile crisis” to shooting the centre out of the “P” on a “Dr. Pepper can.”<blockquote><p align="justify">
    I meet Jack Kerouac for the first time in a Music, Art, and 	literature 	class taught by an ex-Marine and listen intently as he explains 	everything in terms of demolition. There is also a missile crisis.</p><p align="justify">
    high fidelity<br />
    my father’s record with<br />
    the broken needle</p><p align="justify">
    Every summer the family travels south to visit my father’s family in 	Goldthwaite, Texas. My Texan grandfather looks like Will Rogers. 	Wears a Stetson. And cowboy boots. I see windmills for the first 	time. 	Cattle. Horses. Red hot peppers. In this part of the world, 	young 	uncles bend on one knee. Learn to distance themselves from the click 	of a trigger. A bull’s eye shot. They close one eye. Aim. And fire. Never 	missing a blink. Never missing the P in a Dr. Pepper can. My aunt 	Shirley is a lady rancher.  She makes homemade ice cream on the 	front porch.</p><p align="justify">
    dusty morning—<br />
    on a wire fence<br />
    the ram’s bleached skull</p></blockquote><p align="justify">
The first haiku attempts to bridge the two paragraphs, while the latter echoes the landscape of the second paragraph.<p align="justify">Carter’s writing style is characterized by short declarative sentences and sentence fragments that prompt the reader into imagining her experiences. However, there are a handful of works which are not as successful. Here is 
“1995”:<blockquote><p align="justify">
    My sister is scouted to play ice hockey for the Huskies, a women’s 	team at Northwestern University, Boston. A strong left-winger she 	laces up her Bauers every weekend to play teams from Harvard. 	Yale. 	Wellesley. Brown. My mother drives to Mathews Arena to 	watch her 	play.</p><p align="justify">
    after hockey practice<br />
    her long walk<br />
    home</p></blockquote><p align="justify">
For this reader, the prose, a litany of facts, has no emotional draw. The long walk home, in the haiku, might have had an emotional impact, if it occurred after a game rather than “hockey practice.”<p align="justify">
The four tanka sequences, toward the end of the book, feel tacked on. A better balance might have been created if more had been included and dispersed throughout the collection.<p align="justify">
“Tanka Sequence Duet” is the most accomplished and easily a favorite. The fifth and last tanka is the most evocative. Carter is preparing Christmas tea in honour of her mother’s memory. While baking in the solitude of her kitchen, she listens to “The Flower Duet” from the opera<em>Lakmé</em>. She is wearing her mother’s apron and reliving what many mothers and daughters share at the holiday season.<blockquote><p align="justify">
    in my mother’s apron<br />
    I hum along<br />
    with the famous sopranos<br />
    flour dusting my arms<br />
    white jasmine—the snow</p></blockquote><p align="justify">
Carter ends her memoir at the Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics, Boulder, Colorado, where she is visiting. Taken out of context, the final paragraph of “2013,” creatively loops back to earlier subjects of her book as though the author is taking stock of her life.<blockquote><p align="justify">
    Satori. Something cracks open. The cumberbund is an ensō circle. 	Great om of the universe. Drawn in chalk on a sidewalk, not sumi-e 	ink on rice paper. A holding of pain and ecstasy. Lorca’s duende. 	Darkness of Jack Kerouac’s alcoholism and early death. Roman 	candles of his life. My brother’s schizophrenia and disappearance. 	A husband’s failing health. Friends to hold me up. Capturing the 	moment in haiku. Like 	Jack. I know it won’t last.</p><p align="justify">
    snow lions<br />
    melting<br />
    in the sun</p></blockquote><p align="justify">
Carter has condensed her sixty-seven years in the fewest words possible. The memoir is for readers who enjoy a light and easy read that offers a small portal on the pivotal moments of her life.</td></tr></table><p align='center'><img src="#" width="750" height="2" alt="line" /></p><p align="center"><img src="#" width="300" height="40" alt="end" /></p><p align="center">|<a href="https://haibuntoday.thehaikufoundation.org/index101.html">contents page</a> |<a href="AA_Rasmussen_NonPoets.html">next article</a> |<br /><br /></td></tr></table></td><td width="70" valign="top" ><img src="#" width="70" height="1200" alt="koi sidebar r" /><br /><img src="#" width="70" height="2000" alt="koi sidebar r" /></td></tr></table><tr><td ><map name="Map" id="Map"><area shape="rect" coords="174,122,267,139" href="https://haibuntoday.thehaikufoundation.org/index101.html" alt="contents" /><area shape="rect" coords="454,124,536,139" href="https://haibuntoday.thehaikufoundation.org/pages/archives.html" /><area shape="rect" coords="538,124,633,140" href="https://haibuntoday.thehaikufoundation.org/pages/resources.html" /><area shape="rect" coords="635,124,753,139" href="https://haibuntoday.thehaikufoundation.org/pages/submissions.html" /><area shape="rect" coords="754,122,823,141" href="https://haibuntoday.thehaikufoundation.org/pages/search.html" /><area shape="rect" coords="270,122,450,142" href="https://haibuntoday.thehaikufoundation.org/pages/about.html" /></map></body></html>
