Advice for My Parents</strong></p><p align="center">

funeral service—<br />
a basket<br />
of unripe fruit<p align="justify">In the faded photo, the newlyweds are standing near a cabin
nestled in the woods. She’s leaning toward him as if looking for
protection from a bear that might be lurking. He’s looking away,
as if unsure how to pose with his new wife.<p align="justify">She’s nineteen, one year out of a San Francisco orphanage, never
having left the city until now. He’s thirty, raised in a small
town in the Washington backwoods. Her parents were Italian
immigrants—home builders who died in the Spanish Flu epidemic.
His were Danish—hunters, fishermen, foresters.<p align="justify">I want to tell him, “Don’t do it—she’ll bear and love your
children, but she was groomed to be a nun, dreams of being a
singer, hasn't learned to cook and hates housekeeping. She’s
emotional, will yell and cry more than you can bear.”<p align="justify">And her, “Don’t do it—he’ll be stable, a good provider, but he’s
remote, raised with silent Danes as role models. At fifteen he
gave up his dreams of college and became a surrogate
father-provider to his siblings. He'll be a man of few words, your
marriage will be a silence you'll find unbearable.”<p align="justify">I remember one battle in particular. Over the usual dinner of
pasta in tomato sauce, her voice is raised, full of anger and
frustration with her usual lament about how much time he spends
away with his fishing pals. He’s silent, head down,
eating. I’m shoveling in the pasta, wanting to escape  to play with my pals. As I head out the door, I hear her yell, “If you’re
going to go, at least take your son. He’s never once gone fishing
with you!”<p align="center">graveyard visit—<br />
