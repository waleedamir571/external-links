<p align="justify">Haibun Today is pleased and honored to announce the additions of Ruth Holzer and Melissa Allen to its haibun editorial staff. They will join the existing staff of Glenn G. Coats and Ray Rasmussen.
</p><p align="justify"><strong>Ruth Holzer</strong>'s haiku, haibun and tanka have been published in many journals and anthologies over the past decade. She has served as Assistant Editor for <em>tinywords</em> and written reviews for <em>Haibun Today</em>. Her longer poems have been gathered into three chapbooks including <em>A Woman Passing</em> (Green Fuse Poetic Arts). Retired from a career as a linguist, she lives in Virginia. 

 

</p><p align="justify"><strong>Melissa Allen</strong>'s haiku, haibun, and other short poetry have been published in numerous journals and anthologies, including <em>Haiku in English: The First Hundred Years</em> (Norton, 2013). She writes a poetry blog, <a href="http://haikuproject.wordpress.com" target="_blank">Red Dragonfly</a>, has contributed reviews to many publications, and was haibun editor of the short-lived journal <em>Multiverses</em>. She lives in Madison, Wisconsin and, after many years spent working in bookstores, libraries, and archives, home educating her now-grown son, earning a graduate degree in library science, and writing freelance journalism, currently earns her living as a technical writer for a software company.
