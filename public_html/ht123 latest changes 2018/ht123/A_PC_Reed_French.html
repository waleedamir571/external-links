<p align="Center"><strong>Dian Duchin Reed on Terri L. French's "Frequency"</strong>


</p><p align="justify">This haibun puts a light-hearted spin on how my mind constantly tries to make sense of the world (which happens with great "frequency"). What does this mean? How about that? What's a threat, where's the pattern? French's piece is wonderfully elliptical, never even mentioning the word tinnitus. It brings together worry, fantasy, and humor to define the human condition. 

</p>
<p align="justify">As much as the prose, the haiku resonates with me. Its kigo – autumn dusk – gently reminds me that my spring and summer have already been relished, and something new is on the horizon. But it's not yet dark; enough light remains to see the first bat of the evening. Is going batty cause for concern, or might it refer to my fond appreciation for the light-winged insect-eater that navigates this amazing world by high-frequency echo-location? </p>
<p align="justify">This piece made me laugh. It made me nod my head. It made me want to write this commentary as a way to thank Terri French for writing this and sharing it with me via <em>Haibun Today</em>. </p>
<p></p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Background &amp; Bio: </strong></p>
<p align="justify">Dian Duchin Reed is an award-winning writer whose poems and essays have appeared in many publications. Her latest book (Dao De Jing: Laozi's Ancient Wisdom) is a modern translation of a Chinese philosopher whose observations are full of insight and mystery.

<p align="justify">I've always been fascinated by the magic of words when combined in just the right way. I've been a poet for years and have always preferred short poems to long ones, so haiku was a natural part of my evolution as a writer. Haiku led me to the discovery of haibun, which miraculously combines short prose with short poetry. Brilliant! Thank you, Basho. Thank you, <em>Haibun Today</em>. Thank you, Ray Rasmussen.</p>

     <p align="justify">It’s at the pitch only a dog should hear and yet it’s in my head. Not constantly, but periodically, randomly, briefly. And then it’s gone. Until it’s back. I wonder if I am going deaf, or possibly it has to do with my blood pressure. Perhaps aliens are trying to contact me. Or maybe I’m just not wired right.
