 Angelee Deodhar on Bob Lucky's "On a Journey"</strong>


</p>
<p align="justify">In 55 words, this compelling short haibun attracted my attention. Bob Lucky has captured the essence of an important philosophical thought by the great fifteenth century Indian mystic weaver poet, Sant Kabir. 

</p>
<p align="justify">Being an Indian, familiar with Kabir's work, this particular bijak (a document containing a sacred text)  &quot;Wherever I am&quot; represents an entry point conveying a heightened degree of awareness, perhaps due to the journey inside as well as the one being taken in the bus. 
</p>
<p align="justify">The circle, a universal symbol of wholeness, perfection, timelessness, all cyclic movement, is a trap of beginnings and endings, perhaps closure? Some doors have closed and others opened but, this seems to be a contemplation of an endless circle of life, of death, or something the poet cannot seem to grasp however much he tries. 
</p>
<p align="justify">The lack of punctuation also enhances the flow of thought, and although this traveler offers us a world-weary view of the ups and downs of life, as he rests his head against the bus window, the haiku has broken clouds which offer us glimpses of sky, and therefore hope. </p>
<p align="justify">A fine piece of intuitive writing which makes one think.

   Kabir: A Bijak<br />
   </p>
  <p align="justify">Are you looking for me? <br />
   I am in the next seat.<br />
   My shoulder is against yours.<br />
   you will not find me in the stupas, <br />
   not in Indian shrine rooms, <br />
   nor in synagogues, <br />
   nor in cathedrals:<br />
   not in masses, <br />
   nor kirtans, <br />
   not in legs winding around your own neck, <br />
   nor in eating nothing but vegetables.<br />
   When you really look for me, <br />
   you will see me instantly —<br />
   you will find me in the tiniest house of time.<br />
   Kabir says: Student, tell me, what is God? <br />
   He is the breath inside the breath. <br />
  </p>
  <p align="justify">Editor's notes: </p>
  <p align="justify">A stupa is a mound-like or hemispherical structure containing relics (typically the remains of Buddhist monks or nuns) that is used as a place of meditation.</p>
<p align="justify">Kirtan means "narrating, reciting, telling, describing" of an idea or story. It also refers to a genre of religious performance arts, connoting a musical form of narration or shared recitation, particularly of spiritual or religious ideas.</p>
