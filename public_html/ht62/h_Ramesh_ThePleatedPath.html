My poet friend said, "When I was growing up we had no mirrors. People told me I was handsome with my long black hair. You do know I'm a Sikh. But I never understood until one day I had gone with my goats to the river-side where a tree trunk had been placed across the river to get to the other side. Walking across, I sat and looked down at the water and saw myself. I kept repeating in wonder, 'Is this handsome lad me?'"

"Hafiz, a Persian poet, said that when God was coming to the end of his creative prowess, He created a mirror out of water and clay, calling it Man. This man was created with the sole purpose of continuing creation further, beginning from where the almighty had stopped," continued my poet friend. It seemed as if he was almost talking to himself . . .
