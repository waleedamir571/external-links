A Tale of Two Cakes

</strong></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">


Once upon a time, when I was a poor student in Tokyo, I happened to meet at the local railway station another poor student, who lived in the same humble lodgings. Strolling home together we came to a stop
before the window of a glamorous patisserie. 
<p align="JUSTIFY">
"Oh, look!" exclaimed Mariko," <em>mont-blanc</em> . . .  of course, it's autumn now."
<p align="JUSTIFY">
As an Australian, raised on lamingtons and fruit cake, I had no idea what she was talking about. With a hungry gleam in her beautiful brown eyes, Mariko explained <em>mont-blanc</em> was a type of cup-cake, topped with pale brown chestnut puree in the shape of a mountain and crowned with a whole candied chestnut. Japanese food is very seasonal and chestnuts are an autumn speciality. We added up our yen and bought just one small <em>mont-blanc</em> between us.
<p align="JUSTIFY">
Back in Mariko's tiny tatami-mat room, we shared the cake and a pot of green tea. Delicious! Two years later, diagnosed with tuberculosis, Mariko left the Piano Academy and went home to Kyushu to die.

<p align="center">sometimes I dream<br />
of that other life, and<br />
of Mariko<br />
forever twenty-three<br />
all these years I have lived
<p align="JUSTIFY">
Another era, another part of Japan. Not so poor now, I was dining in late spring with a foreign professor I fancied. On the dessert menu I found <em>'ajisai mont-blanc'</em> â€”<em>'hydrangea mont-blanc'</em>. Curious, I ordered this. With a bow the waiter presented, on a plate decorated with real purple hydrangea petals, a classically-formed <em>mont-blanc</em> cake, whose chestnut puree was coloured the same purple as the flower petals.
Of course . . . May, the season for celebrating hydrangea in Japan.
<p align="center">
he and I<br />
so much in common<br />
so much to say . . .<br />
both loving this country,<br />
alas, not each other
<p align="JUSTIFY">                             
In the summer of the following year, enjoying an afternoon snack of perennial red bean buns in Kyoto with a poet colleague, I recounted to her my <em>mont-blanc</em> episodes.
<p align="JUSTIFY">
"Ah," she commented, "through those two cakes you have truly experienced <em>aware</em>, the pitifully transient nature of life and love."
<p align="center">
my life<br />
is what it is, still<br />
contemplating<br />
Japanese tanka<br />
love, longing, and loss
