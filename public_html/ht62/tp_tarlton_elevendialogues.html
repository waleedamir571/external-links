Eleven Dialogues on Dying: Carmody and Blight

</strong>

<p align="center"><em>—in memory of  Jim Percey</em></p>

<p align="center"><strong>1</strong>
<blockquote> 
<p align="JUSTIFY">
<em>CARMODY: It's taken such a long time to grow this old, but that seems beside the point now. <br />
BLIGHT:  Marching to the end.  We're always on the march.</em></blockquote>
 
<p align="JUSTIFY">
On the telephone I learn between sobs and caught breaths that my oldest friend is being moved to hospice—do I want to come and see him?  When he left California decades ago to return to Pennsylvania to teach, I drove all night down from Berkeley to Long Beach to say goodbye to him, and he was waiting on his front porch for me with a pitcher of Manhattans.  I will not make this trip now, however, partly because I am afraid it would undermine a lifetime's memories, but, mainly, because I don't think I could stand it.
 
<p align="center">
it's always now<br />
in this dance of memories<br />
macabre turnings<br />
in a black wind, around<br />
our eyes persistent gnats

<p align="center"> 
the past has gone<br />
before us, all that's left<br />
remembering<br />
each fraction as whispered<br />
happening a given day

<p align="center"> 
dead in my eyes<br />
his life memorialized<br />
what little's left<br />
I throw my heart at clouds<br />
on the wind going east
 
 
<p align="center"><strong>2</strong>
<blockquote> 
<p align="JUSTIFY">
<em>CARMODY:  I am afraid of blood, the sight, even the very idea, of blood.</em> [Pause.]<em> Red, I love red, however. <br />
BLIGHT:  Colors and their quick associations; black as night, perhaps, but I think right away of blood in the stool.</em></blockquote>
 
 
<p align="JUSTIFY">
Down in the village the roads are clogged with cars, like sick arteries.  Up here in the hills the roads are empty and quiet—rainless ruts, teeth in a buried head.  The sun is shining; the breezes make the branches sway, day sits right down upon us.  Sounds of life come from far away, nothing up close.

<p align="center"> 
my head pulses<br />
to the crowding up of things<br />
a dead squirrel<br />
in the road, the ravenous<br />
tentative crows hopping

<p align="center"> 
a faucet drips<br />
its watery <em>bolero</em><br />
in all the rooms<br />
bad thoughts come marching<br />
to its flimsy drumbeat

<p align="center"> 
with a raw joke<br />
and a crude cartoon of Death's<br />
head, black on white<br />
we try to keep on laughing<br />
at jokes about <em>abattoirs</em>
<p align="center"><strong>3</strong>
<blockquote>  
<p align="JUSTIFY">
<em>CARMODY:  Life and death, immorality and hereafter—I see in them manifest the way day ends, the gradual attenuation of the light, the cool coming in of darkness </em>[Satisfied.]<em><br />
BLIGHT: If only we could see in the dark.  </em>[Pause.]<em> Are you afraid of the dark?</em></blockquote>
 
<p align="JUSTIFY"> 
"We'll find out soon enough," the philosopher said.  "Arguments both for and against the afterlife are equally imaginary."  Sister Mary Bridget turned to me and asked: "Does an assertion without proof have the same logical standing as the doubt that questions it?"  She laughed, then gave a quick wave with her hand, and pulled an egg out of my ear.

<p align="center"> 
in a wren's eye<br />
as I held him in my hand<br />
I saw our deaths<br />
a tiny light flickered out<br />
shiny dark surfaces dulled

<p align="center"> 
it's metaphor<br />
you see (even when you don't)<br />
in the darkness<br />
with a magical black light<br />
edges fade to shadows

<p align="center"> 
when you're sleeping<br />
or anaesthetized you're still<br />
exactly where?<br />
coming in or going out<br />
time just has no meaning 
 
 

<p align="center"><strong>4</strong>
<blockquote>  
<p align="JUSTIFY">
<em>CARMODY:  Do you know the worst thing? No?  Well, I'll tell you the worst thing.  The worst thing is how you feel guilty when someone you know is dying . . . you just feel terrible.<br />
BLIGHT:  Imagine how they feel.</em></blockquote>
 
 
<p align="JUSTIFY">
Take any newspaper . . . how many obituaries every day?  Ten?  Fifty?  My God, look at the <em>New York Times</em>.  And of all the people who die, how many even get into the paper?  Or think about India, or Africa.  Dying all over the place—dying, dying, dying.  It's enough to make you sick.

<p align="center"> 
in hospitals<br />
they wash their hands so often<br />
you'd think the skin<br />
might come off—<em>"Out, damned spot! out!"</em><br />
plague's most hermetic question

<p align="center"> 
how would you like<br />
to be the oncologist<br />
that cancer guy<br />
looking death right in the eye<br />
behind his prognoses

<p align="center"> 
it's like a lake<br />
these rivers flow into it<br />
and they flow out<br />
humanity's the wide spot<br />
where the ebb and flow slow down
 
 

<p align="center"><strong>5</strong>
<blockquote>  
<p align="JUSTIFY">
<em>CARMODY:  What must seem enormous to the person dying, i.e., the fact of their dying, can often seem trivial to others.  </em>[Pause.]<em> Maybe we only take it for granted that it seems so significant to the one who is dying.<br />
BLIGHT:  If I were to say, "it all depends," I know you would just ask me, "depends on what?"</em> </blockquote>
 
 
<p align="JUSTIFY">
We always hear that dying is part of living.  Think about that.  Dying just comes up like, say, my needing to urinate or feeling hungry.  You're walking along or just sitting somewhere, and dying shows up, I mean, it just comes along, and so you do it.

<p align="center"> 
the mystery<br />
returns, once they're in the grave<br />
where did they go?<br />
they're not present anymore<br />
they must have gone someplace

<p align="center"> 
why did he go<br />
gently, no burning, no rage<br />
what did he feel<br />
as it came up on him<br />
as it entered into him

<p align="center"> 
it's like hearing<br />
about a toothache. You can't<br />
experience<br />
the sharp, hard, cold nail of it<br />
deeply crippling spasms
 
 

<p align="center"><strong>6</strong>
<blockquote> 
<p align="JUSTIFY">
<em>CARMODY:  In a moment bright as a bubble in the middle of a sunny Saturday, I thought about dying.  It was quite strange, of course.<br />
BLIGHT:  But it's not uncommon.  </em>[Pause.]<em> Why don't we ever say, "I'm absolutely living to get out of here," for example, the way we say, 'I'm dying to meet her."</em> </blockquote>
 
 
<p align="JUSTIFY">
Each day that I stay away from my friend who is dying in hospice, I feel a little guiltier.  He is probably having some good days, even some really lucid moments, but I know that as soon as I arrived there would be moans of pain and a wild blathering that would break my heart.  I do not belong in this phase of his life.  I wouldn't want him healthy and articulate hanging around my deathbed.

<p align="center"> 
don't remind me<br />
how unpleasant the world is<br />
sad all around<br />
I'm struggling to explicate<br />
my attachment to it

<p align="center"> 
I let my eye<br />
loose to sail into the sky<br />
it fled the world<br />
stretched clouds along the wind<br />
refusing to answer me

<p align="center"> 
parallel lives<br />
against the threatened losses<br />
silence, immobility<br />
the living and the dying<br />
rub themselves raw
 
 

<p align="center"><strong>7</strong>
<blockquote>  
<p align="JUSTIFY">
<em>CARMODY:  Death and his desperate little partners—sickness, accident, and fortuity—are coming around a lot these days, you hear more about them, see them sometimes just ducking into an alley, speeding away in a big black car.<br />
BLIGHT:  That was beautiful.</em></blockquote>
 
 
<p align="JUSTIFY">
Here's a metaphor.  A powerful, sudden, multi-colored, shimmering idea comes to you, a strong image filled with reverberation, and you shake your head, rub your eyes, and get to work.  You write a poem, a short, intense, and perfectly crafted verse—you think modestly of Stevens, Williams, Wilbur, and Bidart.  So, you type it up and submit it to <em>Poetry, The Sewanee Review, The New Yorker, Ploughshares,</em> and <em>The Paris Review</em>.  One by one the slips come back in the mail, each expressing the editor's sincere regret at the death of your precious poem.
 

<p align="center">a call at night<br />
she's had another stroke<br />
your poor mother<br />
remembers her manners<br />
gracious and dignified
 
<p align="center">
old love letters<br />
forgotten in a box<br />
there is a name<br />
but no recollection who<br />
wrote such clichéd feelings

<p align="center"> 
how far ahead<br />
can symptoms telegraph<br />
a deadly threat<br />
some small cough in the night<br />
slightly dizzy at the store
 
 

<p align="center"><strong>8</strong>
<blockquote>  
<p align="JUSTIFY">
<em>CARMODY:  If I were dying, I wouldn't want to know it.  Just let the music play, pour the wine, and then come and call me just before the sun comes up.<br />
BLIGHT:  Out of sight, out of mind?</em></blockquote>
 
 
<p align="JUSTIFY">
I can't get near the truth here, my eyes glaze over.  Dear God, why are these things kept secret?  I lean in to kiss Death, but Death is painted roughly black, it is large and black, and square—a whole wall of black.  Is it a picture?  I can't think my way out of this!

<p align="center"> 
God does no work<br />
the universe twirls freely<br />
we live and die<br />
as birds fall from the wires<br />
as light slides to darkness

<p align="center"> 
a memory<br />
she once was fat and living<br />
an old woman<br />
disappeared down a hole<br />
I just vaguely remember

<p align="center"> 
they'll think of me<br />
I think now of them thinking<br />
of me for aye<br />
where did the hours go<br />
all that's left is the waiting
 
 

<p align="center"><strong>9</strong>
<blockquote> 
<p align="JUSTIFY">
<em>CARMODY:  What interests me is the way my remembering some unimportant event, like dinner at a restaurant with him, trumps for a moment the certain knowledge that he is right now suffering.<br />
BLIGHT:  Maybe we just live in a dream world.</em></blockquote>
 
 
<p align="JUSTIFY">
I did not know anyone who died in school or college.  After that, there were a few kids from school who died later in Viet Nam, but no one I knew closely.  Relatives, older people, were, of course, dying all along with way.  It wasn't until I had been working several years in Upstate New York that people I actually knew began dying around me, but most of these were still older, just names in their obituaries.  In the last few years, though, people of my generation have begun dropping like flies.  

<p align="center"> 
I think of ghosts<br />
dreams and memories of dead<br />
acquaintances<br />
can it really be over<br />
for them, just blank pages

<p align="center"> 
death distanced<br />
from breathing, feeling quick<br />
cold cadavers<br />
never can experience<br />
lament, the cleansing sobs

<p align="center"> 
they come in dreams<br />
dead faces, muttering<br />
stings your conscience<br />
you get up in the night<br />
Scotch in a glass of milk
 
 

<p align="center"><strong>10</strong>
<blockquote>  
<p align="JUSTIFY">
<em>CARMODY:   It's exhilarating!  </em>[Stands and breathes deeply, with his full chest.]<em><br />
BLIGHT:  But, not hilarious?</em></blockquote>

His daughter writes that his condition is steadily deteriorating.  He cannot eat because of the cancer, so he is losing weight.  Losing weight leads to a postponing of his surgery. Meanwhile, he gets weaker and weaker, and has even fallen down, more than once.  At a distance of three thousand miles, I am unable to connect any of this to my best friend of fifty years.  I only remember the brash young scholar from Philadelphia, deliberately unwrapping and lighting his familiar cigar, poised to crush some visiting luminary's pale arguments in seminar.

<p align="center"> 
these Christmas lights<br />
reflected in dark windows<br />
red yellow blue<br />
blinking stars in a mirrored<br />
sky—one symbolic angel
 

<p align="center">endless stories<br />
as if reading from a book<br />
each one eager<br />
to establish worthy<br />
<em>bona fides</em>, common themes
 

<p align="center">conscience<sup>1</sup> means two<br />
knowing at once the same thing<br />
in the other's<br />
presence only one story<br />
passes muster as truth
 
 

<p align="center"><strong>11</strong>
<blockquote> 
<p align="JUSTIFY">
<em>CARMODY:  Death is so final it erases all the worry leading up to it.<br />
BLIGHT:  No mourning?  No ritual laments?  No wailing?<br />
CARMODY:  Lift your voices!</em></blockquote>
 
<p align="JUSTIFY">
So, I got the call this afternoon.  My dear old friend has died.  I expected to be grief-stricken, but I'm not.  I'm free now to remember him, to lean again on the bar at <em>Das Gasthaus</em> from noon to 2:00 A.M. or to arrive again at his farm in the cold and after a long January drive for dinner and to resume the political argument from four months before.  His death disencumbers the future (however long that will be for me).  His impending death had me stalled, stuck on a sickening fear, but his son says in an email that he had come to accept dying and was at peace with it.  Put away your tears!
 

<p align="center">a single life<br />
run through to its conclusion<br />
has new meaning<br />
"now against threatened losses<br />
silence, immobility"
 
<p align="center">
he taught them all<br />
the pleasures of the kitchen<br />
how to think past<br />
sacred barriers, piled crap<br />
tell the truth, feint with your right

<p align="center"> 
death punctuates<br />
that's my very last word<br />
exclamation<br />
point sometimes, a period<br />
ampersand, <em>et cetera</em><br />
