Dry it out with bubble gum and send it to the navy.</em><p align="justify">We cling to the safety of a thick tree trunk, the three of us, four years old apiece, peering between the branches in satisfaction as our three-year-old victim cries in confusion. She isn't even sure what we're talking 
about—because, of course, what we're talking about makes no sense—but she can tell we mean her harm. We mean her harm because she's young and weak and we want to believe that we're not. Because there are three of us and one of her. Because we have a sturdy tree to hide behind and she doesn't. We are filled with blinding certainty and superiority until like lightning our tiny, white-haired, ferocious nursery-school teacher descends upon us, the wrath of God coming to punish us for our sins. "Go sit on the porch for the rest of recess!" she shouts. "How dare you make fun of someone like that, someone smaller than you! You should all be ashamed!" And just like that, we all are.<p align="center"><em>mute button<br />
