Today, I stop her and teach the pattern of a long vowel followed by a consonant then silent e. Sadia looks surprised and says she understands. Yet, I taught this pattern to her last year and the year before that.</p><p align="justify">"I can't remember," Sadia says. "I don't know the driver's manual and we went over it again and again. I forget meanings and the girls at work help me with homework. I tell the doctor the medication is too strong. I tell him it makes me forget."</p><p align="justify">I remind Sadia of the Baliwood movies. "You retell whole stories, all the details. I don't have to watch them." Then I remind Sadia of the fairy tale she remembered from her childhood. "It was almost like<em>Cinderella</em>," I say.</p><p align="justify">Sadia doesn't know what happened to the book of stories. She doesn't know where the soldiers took her brother and her father. I finish the lesson and Sadia leaves for work.</p><p align="center"><em>literacy classes<br />

We talk for a moment about winter in the air but there is little to say without books spread before me. I unlock the car, look up, and she is gone.<p align="center"><em>snow at night<br />
