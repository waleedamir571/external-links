I can relate to him not having a permanent home, moving from place to place, waving to people whom he may never see again.<p align="justify">He appears old enough to be my father, were my father alive today. Perhaps he is an ex-vet like papa was. From this distance his beard looks as if it had been stolen from a portrait of Ulysses S. Grant. But as my car's headlights edge closer, I see streaks of dirt near his brow. An army jacket hangs loosely around humped shoulders. He wears oversized combat boots, half laced. With cut-off gloves, he holds up a sign, WORK FOR FOOD.<p align="justify">I have never seen anyone take him in, here or on the other side of the street, where he usually stands. What if papa had rambled down dark streets after Vietnam? I drive past the man and head home.<p align="center"><em>ringed moon . . .<br />
