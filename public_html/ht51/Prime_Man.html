The art gallery exhibition is of sculptures by Ron Mueck: the newborn, the decrepit, a tiny figure called "Dead Dad," a colossal nude cowering in a corner with hatred in his eyes.  One that I'm particularly drawn to is "Man in a Sheet."<p align="justify">
The man—crouched beneath linen, only his head visible—withdraws as if into a shroud.  Yet he evokes a feeling of life and a real sense of existence despite his solitude.  His demeanour suggests a hollowness or a premonition.<p align="justify"> 
The shrouded figure reflects a spiritual condition that might symbolize contemplation.  There's no way of knowing whether this radically reduced figure is battling with his conscience or groping to overcome his inadequacy.<p align="justify">
With his shaved head he could be a monk at his devotions, but the figure of Lazarus brought back to life springs to my mind, his short death making him afraid of the sun/Son.<P align="center"><em>from another room<br />

my hand rests<br />
on the man's marble head<br />
and leaves an ashen print<br />
which can only be seen<br />
in certain angles of light</em><P align="center"><em> 
the brochure describes<br />
these sculptures as alluring—<br />
I think I know<br />
what it means, though<br />
the words are hard to swallow</em></tr></table><p align='center'><img src="#
