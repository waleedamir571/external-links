Ray Rasmussen on Haiku, Haiga and Haibun</strong></p><table align="center" border="0" width="96%"><tbody><tr><td height="4992" valign="top">Ray Rasmussen lives in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada where, in a previous  life, he was Professor of Environmental Policy in the School of Business  at the University of Alberta and an environmental activist. He  currently serves as webmaster for<em>Contemporary Haibun Online</em> and<em>Haibun Today</em> while simultaneously acting as haibun editor for<em>Notes from the Gean</em>.<p align="center"><strong>Beginnings: The Fascination of Haiku and Haiga</strong></p><p align="justify">Ho<em>w and when, Ray, were you first drawn to haiku and to haibun?</em></p><p align="justify">In the late 1980s I took up photography and linked  that to an interest in webpage design. I created a website focused on my  images of the Kurimoto Japanese Garden.1 I wanted to add  Asian poetry to the website, searched the Internet and discovered that  strange little beast called haiku. It struck me that haiku composition  is akin to photography. Landscape photographers find elements in the  chaos of nature that catch the eye and make them stand out visually.  Haiku poets do much the same with words.</p><p align="justify">I next began creating websites that combined  photographs and digital art with the haiku of contemporary poets and the  Japanese Masters.2 Through this intense interaction, I  devoped a deeper feeling for haiku and began to write my own—let's call  them &quot;three-liners&quot;—because, alas, the journal editors weren't very  happy with my early efforts.</p><p align="justify">My excursion into haibun began several years later.  For some years I had been writing essays about certain events in my  personal life and about the environment and politics.3 The  haiku form felt too small a snapshot for what I wanted to share and  haibun, with its focus on the personal, struck me as a suitable vehicle.  British performance poet and humourist, Roger McGough,4 expressed my need for a more expansive form with this little ditty:</p><p align="left">     the only problem<br />
     with haiku is that you just<br />
     get started and then</p><p align="center"><strong>The Man Behind the Curtain</strong></p><p align="justify"><em>You've volunteered your expertise and acted as a  technical editor or webmaster for a number of online journals. Your  activity, in this sphere, began with the World Haiku Club and World  Haiku Review, if I'm not mistaken, and continued, from there, into your  involvement with Simply Haiku and Roadrunner. Can you share something of  the history of your engagements with these various journals and  editors?</em></p><p align="justify">When I started learning about haiku through the  Internet, it was impossible not to find one's way to the activities of  Susumu Takiguchi, chair of the World Haiku Club, an international  organization of haiku poets. I noted that the WHC's website was not up  to snuff and volunteered to create one that was more effective. Soon  after, Takiguchi launched the<em>World Haiku Review</em> which was  webmastered by Debi Bender. I helped Bender with special components of  each issue. I also participated in the WHC's haiku, multimedia and  haibun forums and later became the director of the multimedia forum.</p><p align="justify">At that same time,<em>Simply Haiku</em> was in its  first year of publication under founder and webmaster Rob Mestre and  editor-in-chief Robert Wilson. I became aware that<em>SH</em> might  fold because Mestre was unable to continue due to personal and health  reasons. I wanted to offer something to the haiku community in return  for what I was receiving, so I offered to work with Wilson and created a  new design and served as webmaster and haiga editor for two years.</p><p align="justify">The<em>Roadrunner Haiku Journal</em> launched it's  premiere issue in December of 2004 with a design I created for editors  Jason Brown and Scott Metz that centered on sumi-e type painting by  Metz. I set up the first few issues after which Brown and Metz took  over.   I've also redone the websites for Haiku North America and<em>Time Haiku</em>.</p><p align="justify">My overall aim in providing  web design and webmaster  services was to create attractive websites worthy of the lovely  haiku-genre poems that they contained. I found it unsettling that so  many haiku websites were visual eyesores.</p><p align="justify"><em>The general reader may possess only a sketchy  idea of the time and energy required to produce a literary journal,  whether in print or online. A technical editor or webmaster, in  particular, is the veritable &quot;person behind the curtain&quot;—someone  responsible for much of the heavy work. Because there is little public  appreciation or acknowledgement of such personal sacrifice, the rewards,  if they exist, must be of a different order. What, in your experience,  has made your technical work worth the effort and where, in particular,  have you felt challenged or frustrated?</em></p><p align="justify">It's true, Jeffrey, that few people—and I'd include  the editors of online journals unless they are themselves  webmasters—have an appreciation of the time and skill required to set up  a well-functioning and attractive online journal. You originally set up  and ran the<em>Haibun Today</em> blog. Blog sites are  websites-made-easy but are still difficult to administer, so you have a  taste for the complexity behind all those nice looking pages. We journal  webmasters have a number of issues to deal with while using HTML  (Hypertext Markup Language). If you'd like to see the complexity behind a  webpage, go up to the &quot;view&quot; menu of your browser and click on &quot;view  source&quot;—the source being the HTML computer language behind the website  you are viewing. Today, the task is made easier through web design  softwares like Dreamweaver. The webmaster's task is easier if the  journal is focused on a single genre as with<em>Contemporary Haibun Online, Haibun Today</em>, and the<em>Roadrunner Haiku Journal</em>. When journals include multiple genres, the task can be akin to a one day a week job. Bender's webmastering of the<em>World Haiku Review</em>,  which was a multi-genre, -language and -region journal, was nothing  short of a heroic service to the haiku community. I burned out with the  relatively less complex<em>Simply Haiku</em> after only two years.</p><p align="justify">This isn't to suggest that it's the webmaster who makes a journal work.<em>Simply Haiku</em>,  for example, had the recruiting and organizing activities of Wilson as  editor-in-chief and the copy and management editorial services of Johnye  Strickland and Carol Raisfeld, all very time consuming and essential  tasks. However, just as a journal can be lost because the owner-editor  has moved on for whatever reason, so can it be lost when it loses its  webmaster.</p><p align="center"><strong>Setting Sail: The Broad Horizon of Haibun</strong></p><p align="justify"><em>Around 2005, you designed a website for</em>Contemporary Haibun Online<em> and helped launch that publication, probably the first periodical in  English dedicated exclusively to haibun. What desire or need inspired  the creation of</em>CHO<em>?</em></p><p align="justify">After a number of my haibun pieces had been  published, I became aware that haibun was the poor relative of haiku.  Quarterly print journals like<em>Modern Haiku, Frogpond, Blithe Spirit</em> and<em>Bottle Rockets</em> and the online journals like<em>Simply Haiku</em> were publishing hundreds of haiku, but very few haibun. Other key journals like<em>The Heron's Nest</em> published haiku exclusively. At the time, the only print journal devoted to haibun was<em>Contemporary Haibun</em>, but it's is an annual containing haibun that have been published elsewhere during the previous year. Similarly, the<em>Red Moon Anthology</em> which has a haibun section only contains previously published work.</p><p align="justify">So I approached<em>Contemporary Haibun</em> Editor  Jim Kacian and suggested that we create an online quarterly journal  dedicated solely to haibun. Jim agreed and brought along his<em>CH</em> co-editors Ken Jones and Bruce Ross. I created the<em>CHO</em> design and became and still am its technical manager (aka webmaster).  I'm pleased to see it in it's seventh year of publication.</p><p align="justify"><em>Far more haibun are now published annually than  was previously the case. What, in your opinion, are the positives and  negatives of this circumstance? Is there a qualitative as well as  quantitative advance? And has anything been lost during haibun's recent  expansion?</em></p><p align="justify">There has been an obvious quantative advance with the presence of both<em>CHO</em> and<em>HT</em> and the start-up of new journals like<em>Notes from the Gean</em> which now has a haibun section. Does 'quantity' work to the good of the  genre? My answer is 'yes' at this point in time for several reasons.  Literary editors exercise poetic sensibilities when deciding to accept  or reject a piece. Overall, more journals (and editors) means that more  sensibilities are at play and, thus, that more diverse pieces are likely  to be published, including those that deviate from the orthodoxy that  has already gathered around haibun composition just as it did decades  earlier around haiku composition. Some haibun editors, as one example,  will not accept prose plus tanka (tanka prose), while others will. That  writers can experiment with the form and have their work published in a  journal with experienced editors encourages development of the genre and  of its practitioners. And some editors have greater or even exclusive  experience with one genre (e.g., haiku as opposed to haibun or prose  composition). Thus some editors will focus primarily on the haiku and on  the pronounced rule that 'the haiku must stand alone' while others will  focus on the prose and a haiku that is supported by the prose.</p><p align="justify">In saying this, I have a caveat in mind. Obviously,  it takes more than a multiplicity of journal outlets to make a form  viable. While the editors will have different sensibilities, they also  need to be respected both by writers for their ability to judge and by  readers for their ability to present good work. So just anyone hanging  out an online haibun journal shingle won't do.</p><p align="justify"><em>I presume that your commitment to</em>CHO<em> coincides with an increased personal interest in haibun as over-and-against haiku.</em></p><p align="justify">One can't have an interest in writing haibun without  an interest in writing competent haiku. In my view, it's not just the  prose style (succinct, haiku-like, etc.) but also the link to a haiku  that makes a haibun something more than a journal entry, a short  fictional story, a prose poem or an essay. But it's true that the story  that I get to tell via the prose part of the haibun is what keeps me  writing and wanting to promote the haibun form.</p><p align="justify"><em>You were instrumental in founding the Writer's Workshop, Ray, during the same period as</em>CHO<em>'s  advent. It is fair to observe that the Workshop has played a quiet but  significant role in the development and maturation of many haibun  writers. Perhaps you would like to reflect upon the Workshop.</em></p><p align="justify">Not many people know about the Writer's Workshop,  Jeffrey. As a new writer I felt increasingly frustrated by the lack of  mentoring and feedback available in various online forums. In my  experience, the forums consisted of writers posting work that rarely was  submitted for or reached publication and that mostly received what are  best called 'attaboys'—diplomatically encouraging responses to the  posted work, however good or bad. In short, the online venues tended to  be places where people shared, but did not seem to have an interest in  developing their work. This isn't to say that sharing isn't an important  service provided by such forums. There's a social aspect to sharing  poetry and many writers don't aspire to publication. I had also asked  various haiku and haibun poets for feedback and learned that most were  too busy with their own writing to offer sustained mentoring. I  benefited early on through the WHC haiku workshops for new writers, but  that was a rare opportunity that no longer exists.</p><p align="justify">It was with that lack of mentoring in mind that Lynn  Edge and I formed the Writer's Workshop in 2004. Initially the workshop  consisted of just a few writers new to haibun who wanted to improve  their writing and succeed in having it published. Our aim was to provide  a developmental forum where candid feedback was the norm, not the rare  exception. Since those beginnings, about ten writers have been involved  in any given year.</p><p align="justify">As to the success of the WW, the past and present  members appear regularly in all of the haiku journals and it would be  tempting to attribute some of their success to the workshop. However, I  can only speak for myself as to its value. Whatever personal poetic  sensibility sparks a fellow member to suggest a problem with one of my  pieces, a door is inevitably opened that I most often enter and use as  the basis for revisions. After several cycles of revisions (we also post  and receive comments on revisions), I usually feel better about the  piece and more confident about submitting it.</p><p align="center"><strong>The Whole Story: One Approach to Haibun Composition</strong></p><p align="justify"><em>I want to turn now to a discussion of your  writing as against the various aspects of your service, if you will, to  the haikai community. Your published haibun are numerous. An attempt to  single out one as representative or characteristic would likely be  misleading. Instead, I would prefer to quote one of your titles that I  know well and simply allow you to place it, for the reader, in its  proper context.</em></p><blockquote><p align="justify"><strong>Unsaddled</strong>5</p><p align="justify">&quot;Breakfast without a newspaper is a horse without a saddle.&quot;<br />
—Edward R. Murrow</p><p align="justify">I am six months into my experiment of not reading the  daily newspaper at breakfast. Instead I read essays, including one by  E.B. White, who, in response to Murrow's metaphor, called breakfast &quot;the  hour when we sit munching stale discouragement along with fresh toast.&quot;  Breakfast is more enjoyable, but I sometimes feel I've missed something  important—something others know that I don't but should. Stretching  Murrow's metaphor, it's me that's unsaddled—riderless. This morning, as I  walk the dog on the berm overlooking the Whitemud Freeway, there's the  usual tangle of commuters, all hurrying somewhere.</p><p align="justify">winter morning—<br />
the cat mews<br />
over her empty bowl</p></blockquote><p align="justify">An important aspect of my storytelling is an intent  to express the fullness of the human psyche or as Jungian psychologists  would put it, the shadow side, as well as the more open or socially  acceptable side of the self.6 &quot;Unsaddled&quot; isn't an abstract  essay on the pros and cons of retirement. Nor is it a piece about the  joys of retirement. Instead it offers a glimpse of how one person  experiences post-retirement mornings. Each of my haibun 'outs' the real  me as best I know myself. Many contain observations and feelings that  would not usually be discussed openly and that might be uncomfortable  for others to read. This idea of 'outing' oneself is not very common if I  am to judge by the haibun I read in the journals. Nor should it  necessarily be.  But often I get the impression that for some writers,  life is but a walk in a garden amongst flowers and butterflies.  &quot;Unsaddled&quot; is an attempt to expose the light and dark sides of  retirement as I experience them.</p><p align="justify">A consequence of writing with this intent is that my  writing often brings with it a feeling of vulnerability. What will  others make of this true aspect of myself? One test I have of my work is  how vulnerable I feel when I send a piece off for publication or when I  send it to family or friends. I remember particularly a comment from a  member of the Writer's Workshop asking whether I really wanted to  publish a piece about a visit to a STD clinic. She felt that it was too  personal and revealing. It is, but that piece entitled &quot;Public Exposure&quot;  appears in this issue of<em>Haibun Today</em>.</p><p align="justify">Something else that I've had to come to grips with,  Jeffrey, is that storytelling requires embellishment and omission. My  aim is to give a feel for a true experience, but not to describe it in  such precise detail that it becomes boring to read. Each piece requires  judgments about whether the embellishments move the piece too far in the  direction of 'unreal' (aka fictional) or incomplete (e.g., lacking  significant detail). In short, I see a key characteristic of haibun as  involving the obvious 'presentation of self,'7 while telling the story in an enticing and succinct way.</p><p align="justify">A related concern is how to make the prose  'haiku-like.' When I first drafted &quot;Unsaddled,&quot; it had four times as  many words. It took nine drafts and copious feedback from my fellow  writers to cut it to the bone. Paul Conneally, once the director of the  WHC's haibun forum, recommended stripping a first draft down into  phrases and leaving out the connective tissue.  From that set of  haiku-like phrases, one rebuilds the haibun. Some writers have told me  that the spontaneity of the first draft creates a spark that can be lost  with too much polishing. While this may be true, I think that the  natural feel comes back into a piece if the writer works hard enough in  the revisions. In my view, spontaneous first drafts often fail because  of a lack of well thought-out structure and poor wordsmithing.</p><p align="justify">Another aspect of my writing is that I've connected  my experience in &quot;Unsaddled&quot; to that of writers whom I admire. I like to  emphasize that a person's experiences today are common to others  writing from the past. When I integrate work from other writers into my  haibun, I feel as if that person's voice has spoken directly to me–that  we've become better acquainted. In some cases, I will model my haibun on  another poet's work.8 I do this because a theme in the poem  resonated in me and I wanted to delve more deeply into that theme with  my own writing and experience.</p><p align="justify">Related to this is that I'd like my haibun to offer  the possibility of introspection to the reader. While a young person or a  non-retiree reading &quot;Unsaddled&quot; will not be likely to identify with my  experience, I think that most retirees will. If I share something real  about my inner world, perhaps others will find it to be of value.</p><p align="justify">A final aspect of my writing has to do with the  common pronouncement that the haiku must stand alone.  I suppose that  the haiku in &quot;Unsaddled&quot; can stand alone, but it doesn't matter to me  whether it does. The key for me is whether the poem enhances the prose  and brings about a mental shift on the part of the reader from the ease  of reading of a good short story to the more difficult, almost  meditative state, required in reading a haiku.</p><p align="center"><strong>Dialogue Within, Dialogue Without</strong></p><p align="justify"><em>Many writers can identify readily a composition  that has special significance in their development. I imposed my  selection from your work upon you in my earlier question. I invite you,  Ray, to make your own selection and to discuss the personal importance  of this particular haibun to its author.</em></p><p align="justify">I'll pick one that demonstrates some characteristics  of my writing that perhaps aren't very common in haibun composition and  that will illustrate a few aspects of my writing beyond those I  discussed above.</p><blockquote><p align="justify"><strong>Trying It On</strong>9</p><p align="justify">&quot;I feel so comfortable with you,&quot; she says, her hand lightly brushing my chest.</p><p align="justify">Comfortable? I try wearing the word. It's like my  bathrobe that long ago should have been rag-bagged. Soft and warm . . .  yet so full of holes. Or like the overstuffed chair that Dad fell asleep  in while watching golf on TV.</p><p align="justify">&quot;Comfortable,&quot; I say to her. &quot;Instead how about 'When  I'm with you I feel like a baby bird about to make her first leap into  space?' Okay, you're not a young chick. Then how about, 'I feel like a  matador dancing with a flame-snorting bull?' Or better yet, 'I love the  tension I feel when you take off your biker boots revealing the cobra  tattoo etched on your big toe nail?'&quot;</p><p align="justify">dusk<br />

in the mail</p></blockquote><p align="justify">Many of my haibun contain internal dialogues and/or  dialogues taken from exchanges with other persons. When I started  writing what I call &quot;dialogue haibun,&quot; some of the members of the  Writer's Workshop suggested that I might have trouble finding an editor  who would accept them. But I've gotten a very good reception from a  variety of editors.  I select a dialogue as a subject for the same reason others might select  an outstanding moment in nature or a significant aspect of a travel  journey. Something in the dialogue led to an emotional reaction or to  feeling unfinished about what transpired.</p><p align="justify">Paragraph 1 contains part of a dialogue initiated by a woman I had been dating steadily for several months.</p><p align="justify">Paragraph 2 switches to what I call an internal  dialogue—my unspoken musings about her initial statement. These musings  aren't what really went though my mind at the time. They're a polished  embellishment, hopefully funny, of my associations with the appellation  &quot;comfortable.&quot;</p><p align="justify">Paragraph 3 is what I replied at the time. It's a  made-up response to her initial statement designed to exaggerate my  reaction to the point of being humorous. As you may guess, Jeffrey,  poets like Issa who used humor have influenced my writing. I can't know  whether readers will find humor in the piece, but I enjoyed letting my  &quot;macho man&quot; have a full fling at the word &quot;comfortable.&quot;</p><p align="justify">Both haiku are embellished. I rode a motorcycle when I  was younger and often have the urge to buy a Harley—not the Hell's  Angels type, but more the road-trip bike. While a catalogue didn't  arrive in the mail, a friend, tired of hearing me express my desire for a  bike, gave me a Harley catalogue. Nor did I pass a tattoo parlor three  times. The haiku was meant to be a humorous depiction of a man who is,  in fact, ambivalent about having a tattoo, but who kind of wants one.  That's me. So no, I don't have a cobra tattoo etched on my big toenail  or anywhere else.</p><p align="justify"><em>You published your first haibun in 2003, if I'm  not mistaken. What has changed in your writing, in terms of style or  content, over that period? And what elements or preoccupations, in your  view, have remained fairly constant?</em></p><p align="justify">Previous to writing haiku and haibun, I  wrote essays and, of course, articles throughout my career as an  academic social scientist. So the important transformation was from  writing longish, and as I reread them, rather boorish didactic essays.  My essay on the World Trade Organization, &quot;Making Sense of Seattle,&quot;  serves as an example.10  The essay &quot;Anas and the Ice Flow&quot;11 serves as an example of the transformation from the didactic to a haibun style as &quot;Journey to the Far North.&quot;12Another  change is now that I have a large body of published haibun, I've begun  to focus on putting together themed collections. The first of these is  the<em>Canyonlands Journal</em> website13 which uses a mix of photographs and haibun to depict my explorations of the primitive canyon country of southern Utah.</p><p align="justify">But perhaps the biggest change has to  do with subject matter as opposed to style. Over the last eight years,  my writing has shifted from my experiences in exploring wilderness areas  to four additional themes some of which I've begun to draft as  websites: 1) retirement and aging,14 2) fall romance—the world of dating for those of us who are past middle age and our first marriages,15  3) family issues—memories of parents, marriage issues, divorce, the  difficulties of raising children in the era of drugs, sex and the new  media, and 4) loss—the death of parents, friends, spouses, children and  even pets.</p><p align="justify">I've also begun writing articles and doing reviews and interviews.16  In your own essays, Jeffrey, you've pointed out that to be viable a  genre needs a body of criticism. Take a look at any journal and you'll  note that most of the literary criticism is focused on haiku. Here  again, the haibun genre is the poor relative, but that's to be expected  at this early stage of the genre's life. Having made a small beginning  in this area, I'm now more aware of and impressed by the skill and  devotion of those involved in producing competent literary criticism.</p><p align="center"><strong>Word and Image</strong></p><p align="justify"><em>Your</em>Canyonlands Journal<em>(2010)  combines your interests in writing with photographs of the canyon  country of Utah and New Mexico. How does this recent project relate to  your previous work in wedding haikai to photography?</em></p><p align="justify">Most of my previous haiga-type work  was the usual mix of a single image coupled with a single poem or  collections consisting of the work of other poets coupled with my  photography. The<em>Canyonlands Journal</em> is different in that it's a  collection of my published haibun mixed with images that aren't  necessarily associated with a particular haibun and that don't have a  poem directly attached to them. The haibun and images stand on their own  pages. My aim was to give the reader a feel for the visual beauty and  variety of Utah's canyon lands through a mix of photography and writing.  Because I'm a photographer, I tend to think that words alone can not  transmit the exquisite beauty of a landscape like the canyon country of  southern Utah. The images provide a visual context for the haibun.</p><p align="justify"><em>Haiga are still painted by some  poets in the traditional manner while other haiga mix watercolor,  collage, digital and other media with haiku. Some purists may be  dismissive of efforts, like your own, that rely on the camera instead of  the brush. How, beyond personal preference, does photography add  something to haiku? Or, to pose the question differently, do haiku and  photography share an aesthetic principle that argues for the adoption of  the photograph as a fit medium for haiga</em>?</p><p align="justify">Jeffrey, in one of your essays you stated, &quot;if an individual haiku does truly 'stand alone,' why encumber it with prose at all.&quot;17  In the context of haiga, we can also ask, why marry a poem to an image?  In short, why haiga of any stripe? One reason that some might give is  that the early masters like Basho and Buson did so and their work became  the foundation for contemporary haiga—the haiga 'bible' so to speak—for  the world beyond Japan. These early haiga masters used two elements,  ink brush painting and a haiku expressed through calligraphy. It may be  true that there are purists who maintain that haiga should be  hand-painted art with hand-painted calligraphic text. However, most  practitioners and editors seem to accept that two legitimate forms are  evolving in contemporary haiga practice. When I was the haiga editor for<em>Simply Haiku</em>, we divided the haiga section into two categories: traditional and new forms that included digital art and photography.<em>Haigaonline</em> similarly divides its offerings into traditional and contemporary haiga.</p><p align="justify">Pertaining to this business of mixing  images and poems, I believe that there are two types of readers. Some  respond primarily to words and don't require or may not want a visual  supplement. These are people who, for example, may have felt  disappointed as was I with the film<em>Lord of the Rings</em> because  their mental images of Tolkein's Hobbits, Elves, Dwarfs and Orcs are  different, and often preferable, to those offered by the film maker.  Others tend to feel helped by visual cues in forming a deeper  association with a poem or prose passage. Thus many books contain visual  images and many people prefer seeing a film to reading a book. On the  other hand, it could be argued that presenting a visual element along  with a poem is a kind of crutch that prevents a person from developing  the ability to go deeply into the words of a poem. And some have argued  that the accumulation of visual detail lessens or even eliminates an  ambiguity that is desirable in poetry.</p><p align="justify">There are several issues that will  undoubtedly be discussed with some vigor over the next decades of  practice and publication of contemporary haiga. How good does the art or  photography have to be? Many of today's practitioners are neither good  artists nor good photographers, but then Basho wasn't known as a very  good artist either. Perhaps his rather primitive paintings and  calligraphy give us a deeper feel for the poet's work or perhaps Basho  simply enjoyed exploring his poetry in visual form. Given that fine art  is more likely to come from the hand of a person who has been at it for  some time and that photographs are relatively easy to make, it's no  surprise that there's a reasonable amount of good artwork done by haiga  painters and a lot of not-so-great photography offered by haiga  photographers. Related to this is whether photography is considered to  be fine art, akin to painting, or something less demanding. After all,  anyone can produce a reasonable snapshot with today's cameras. In my  view, dedicated photographers are producing artwork in a different,  modern form. I also believe that the quality of artwork and photography  will continue to rise as the number of practitioners and their  experience with the form increases.</p><p align="justify">My personal answer as to the why of an  image-poem mix is that I enjoy making images and associating them with a  verbal snapshot. The creation of a visual image for a haiku I'm  considering helps me to explore the haiku. Alternatively, the  composition of a haiku to marry an image helps me to go deeper into why I  captured the image and what I see in it.</p><p align="justify"><em>And what relation do electronic  publications, such as your website journal or e-books, have to the  traditional paperback or hardcover poetry volume? Can the print and  electronic media coexist?</em></p><p align="justify">With respect to print vs. electronic  media (webpage, blog, ebook), the issue is an easy one for me. It's very  expensive to produce a print book with good photographic quality. An  image that looks great on a backlit computer screen won't look nearly as  good on paper unless the image, the printing process and the paper are  all of very high quality. Try printing one of your own snapshots on  plain paper and you'll immediately understand what I mean. Art galleries  utilize special lighting to enhance the viewing of photographic prints.  While most chapbooks and publications by small poetry houses are at  best a break-even possibility, a collection of poetry plus well-done  images tends to be very costly and almost certainly won't break even.  Most self-publishing poets and small-house publishers of poetry don't  have the deep pockets to support such work.</p><p align="justify">But all is not lost. I am considering  turning my collections into ebooks that can be downloaded on a medium  other than a computer screen, e.g., on a Kindle or iPad reader. In all  cases, website, blogsite, ebook, the images can look very good without  the excess costs associated with a print book.</p><p align="justify">Another issue has to do with  durability. I suppose there's an irony that haijin may wish to have  their writing endure forever. While an academic, I became aware of the  cost problems in preserving books in university libraries. Of course,  many have made a transition, first to micro-film and later to electronic  storage. Whether electronic media will prove more durable and less  costly to store remains to be seen. Websites and blogs tend to disappear  when their creators lose interest or pass away.  And electronic media  is constantly changing which makes the viewing of present works with  future technology an iffy prospect. Try, for example, buying a device  that will still play tapes.</p><p align="justify">With respect to the storage of  haiku-genre materials, I'm aware that some libraries are now making  efforts to ensure that some online materials are preserved. Journals  like<em>Simply Haiku, Haibun Today</em> and<em>Contemporary Haibun Online</em> should be stored by some electronic cataloging system. One hopes that  an organization like the newly formed Haiku Foundation18 will assume  this role. Otherwise our electronic journals may suffer the fate of the<em>World Haiku Review</em> which for now has unfortunately disappeared.</p><p align="justify">As to whether the two forms, paper and  electronic, can coexist, I tend to think that print collections of  poetry will continue to exist because many people like the feel of a  book, particularly a small collection of poetry, and the look of books  in their bookshelves and on their table tops.</p><p align="center"><strong>Haibun in the Next Decade</strong></p><p align="justify"><em>One year ago, you joined the staff of</em>Notes from the Gean<em> as haibun editor. Literary editing requires closer contact with  contributors than does technical editing. Has this new role altered your  perspective on the haibun community? Or has it confirmed your prior  opinions?</em></p><p align="justify">I've been reluctant to serve as an  editor, in part because it's a lot of work to conscientiously read  submissions and make a decision, and in part  because I hate to say 'No'  to any writer who is giving haibun a try. I'm also aware of my biases  in haibun composition and feel awkward being a judge of other's work.</p><p align="justify">In the end, I said yes to the editors at<em>Notes from the Gean</em> because I admired them as writers and thought that a haibun section  would be an important addition. I also felt that I should serve the  haiku community as well as receive the benefits of the work of the  editors who have dedicated themselves to that task.</p><p align="justify">The work submitted to<em>Notes</em> often leads me to think that if only the writers were members of a  writing workshop, their pieces could be greatly enhanced through candid  feedback from other writers and the redrafting process. But there aren't  many opportunities for detailed feedback prior to submission for  publication. So that leaves the task to the editors. Many editors won't  provide feedback because there is often an adverse response from the  writers. But like you, Jeffrey, at<em>Haibun Today</em>, and Lynne Rees when she was haibun editor for<em>Simply Haiku</em>,  I provide feedback as part of my practice. This makes editing a lot  more work. And I've had the predictable mixed reactions, some negative,  but mostly positive. A danger is that a writer will feel bound to accept  an editor's suggestions as a means of getting his or her work  published. A further danger is that an editor's feedback creates an  implicit demand for revisions fitting the editor's style. Thus, without  meaning to, editors may impose their voices and styles on the writer and  variety may be diminished.</p><p align="justify"><em>What role do you foresee for</em>Notes from the Gean<em>, and for other general short form poetry journals like it, in the future growth of haibun?</em></p><p align="justify">I think that the present mix of print  and online journals publishing haibun is about right—that is, dedicated  writers can now get their work published, particularly if they're  willing to accept feedback and the ups and downs of rejection, or as a  friend has put it, of 'subjection.' The presence of online journals  permits the publishing of long haibun and tanka prose pieces whereas it  seems that some print journal editors are either unable or unwilling to  devote the space required by a haibun. Corresponding with this recent  growth of haibun venues, there are a number of new writers working in  the genre. A reasonable maturity in writing comes after what? 5 or 10  years? longer? So the prospects are good that we'll have a polished new  cadre appearing in future issues and that the overall quality of writing  will continue to improve. I don't know how to fix the lack of mentoring or candid feedback. At<em>CHO</em>, we've taken the &quot;editor's choice&quot; idea from<em>THN</em> and added an &quot;editor's pick&quot; to each issue so that writers can get a glimpse into what a particular editor sees in a piece.</p><p align="justify">Overall, the genre doesn't need new  journals at this point. We need forums with candid feedback processes  and literary commentary of published work to help new writers develop  their skills. I had the thought that it would be of value to create a  publication that shows how a published haibun developed  from draft to  draft and the kind of feedback provided by other writers. I'm tempted to  do this as a haibun-genre website. It would be helpful if a beginners'  workshop for haibun composition were available. But who will volunteer?</p><p align="justify"><em>I want to thank you, Ray, for your  patience and participation in this interview. One last question, if I  may. How would you compare the haibun scene of today to that of five or  seven years ago? What are the prospects for haibun tomorrow?</em></p><p align="justify">I like to think that the popularity of  haibun—both the reading of and writing of the form—will continue to  grow. There's been a parallel growth of the similar forms called flash  fiction and prose poems. In part, that's because haibun is a form of  storytelling and it's easy for the general reader to relate to a  well-told story.</p><p align="justify">I also think that the growth of haibun  composition and readership will eventually lead to a further growth in  haiku readership and comprehension. Reading a haiku is an acquired  skill, just as reading a complex poem with obscure allusions is an  acquired skill.</p><p align="justify">In closing, I'll refer to ex-poet  laureate of the U.S., Billy Collins who has produced a best-selling  collection of poems selected for being reader-friendly.19 His premise is  that readership of poetry will grow provided that there are viable  pathways into the genre for new readers. In similar vein, I see a need  for collections of reader-friendly genres like haibun which, in turn,  should lead to a greater appreciation of what I consider to be the more  difficult-to-grasp and elusive haiku.</p><hr /><p align="justify">Footnotes</p><p align="justify">1.<a href="http://raysweb.net/japanesegardens/" target="_blank">Kurimoto Japanese Garden</a>: A website by Ray Rasmussen</p><p align="justify">2.
