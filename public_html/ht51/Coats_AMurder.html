I hear the crows. They are talking softly in contented voices.<em>Do they speak of rings and bracelets snatched from open windows? Are their nests lined in silver?</em></p><p align="justify">Crows steer clear of my place and choose instead the backyard of my neighbor who does not like people. He avoids humans. Darts in his house when a car rumbles down the gravel lane or when he hears joggers talking as they run. Never waves. Never says a blessed thing. Crows fuss all day behind his burning can. Even before a shotgun blasts in the forest, they caw in their warning voices.<em>Does he throw them bread and scraps? Does he leave the lid off the trash can?</em></p><p align="justify">Jehovah's Witnesses are at his door now. Their clothes dark as pine trunksâ€”the wings of crows. They hold bibles and papers under their arms and wait. He won't answer the door and listen to what they have to say. I could tell them not to waste their time and move on to the next place. They can't hear me, not with all the crows raising such a racket.</p><p align="center"><em>moonlit blossoms<br />
