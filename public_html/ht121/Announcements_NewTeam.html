<p align="justify">
 
 We're pleased to announce that Donna Buck has agreed to serve as tanka prose guest editor for our June issue. Starting with the release of our March issue, she'll receive and respond to all submissions. Janet will return to edit our September and December issues. Donna's biographical information is included below. </p>
<p align="justify">We're also pleased to announce the addition of two regular haibun editors, Terri French and Rich Youmans. Melissa Allen and Ray Rasmussen remain, so we now have a volunteer staff of four to help with the workload. Each editor will be responsible for one issue. Melissa Allen will serve as editor for our June issue. Biographies for Terri and Rich are included below.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Donna Buck</strong> of Carlsbad, California, has had a lifelong fascination with language and poetry.  She discovered Japanese short form poetry in 2011 after a life-changing injury that required a year of recovery and reflection. Her tanka, tanka prose, and haibun have appeared in print and online journals, including <em>Haibun Today</em>, <em>Contemporary Haibun Online</em>, <em>A Hundred Gourds</em>, <em>Ribbons</em>, <em>Skylark</em>, <em>Gusts,</em> and <em>Moonbathing</em>, and have earned Honorable Mentions in international tanka contests. She writes often when walking the local lagoons in the company of herons, and is happiest in nature. One of Donna's haibun appears in this issue. Examples of her tanka prose published in <em>Haibun Today</em>:</p>

<p><strong>Terri French</strong> of Huntsville, Alabama, attended her first writer’s conference at age 12. She went on to graduate with a BA in journalism. She discovered her love for Japanese short form around 2006. Her haiku, haibun, and haiga have appeared in <em>Haibun Today, Contemporary Haibun Online, Frogpond, A Hundred Gourds</em>, and <em>Modern Haiku</em>, and have placed in several prestigious contests. Terri is a past Southeast coordinator for The Haiku Society of America and former editor of <em>Prune Juice Journal </em>of senryu and kyoka. Her first book of haibun, <em>Keepers</em>, will come out this year. Currently, Terri serves on the board of directors for <a href="https://www.thehaikufoundation.org/" target="_blank">The Haiku Foundation</a>. She and her husband, Ray, plan on retiring next year and trading their house for an RV, so they can spend every day hiking with their dog, and, of course, finding more writing inspiration. Examples of her work published in <em>Haibun Today</em> and elsewhere:</p>
