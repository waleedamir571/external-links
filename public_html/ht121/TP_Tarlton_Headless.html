Hired workers carefully plowed the top layer of soil, scratching down about two inches. Archeology students came along behind, shoveling the loosened dirt, clods, rocks, and gravel with masonry trowels onto large, flat screen sieves and then poured buckets of water carefully over them. The soil and stiff clay washed away, leaving the small stones, bones, shells, and pieces of broken tile. </p><p align='center'>

This went on for weeks—the plowing, shoveling, troweling, raking, and sieving—until after lunch one day we all heard the sudden sharp click as a student's trowel digging in the loose dirt hit something hard. All work stopped.</p>

Now everyone gathered around the professor, who was down on his knees carefully scraping dirt loose and brushing it away. Slowly an impermeable surface like rock or cement was emerging. It was rounded and smooth, rough and ragged in ways Nature never could have caused.</p><p align='center'>

We thought at first maybe it was a shard of pottery, and from its size we guessed it might be the broken and discarded handle from a large amphora. As the dirt and clay fell away, however, something more momentous gradually appeared. </p><p align='center'>

</p><p align="justify">
What lay under the dirt for millennia was now exposed as the weird pocked surface of a stone cicatrix where we guessed, as it more and more emerged, a neck and a head had been. </p><p align='center'>

</p><p align="justify">
The professor continued to dig and brush, but no greater complexity was revealed. It turned out both arms as well as the head and neck were missing, snapped off at the shoulders, and further down both legs, too, were gone. A torso stood before us, alone in its cuirass armor.<br /><br /></p><hr align="left" width="200" noshade="noshade" /><p align="justify">
