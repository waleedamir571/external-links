<p align="justify">
Was it karma? Stolen from my firm by a rival, a former client asked out of the blue to be taken back after a half dozen years. I'd serviced them for fifteen years and knew everybody there in some degree or other before politics, call it a knife, intervened.

</p><p align="justify">
After working out the details today, of getting reacquainted, of hearing what currently ails their paper machines and signing what needed to be signed, I asked M. in Purchasing about Jake. I'd already learned from the others on the machine floor that he'd recently died. I had liked him. He was hardworking, the quietest man I had ever met. I asked her especially because I knew that they'd worked together for many years, since the plant's inception.

</p><p align="justify">
M. leaned forward across her desk and lowered her voice to the pitch of a rumor.

</p>
<p align="justify">
	          "At Jake's funeral, his wife came up to me and told me that one night Jake had called out for me in his sleep: can you imagine!" said M., blushing, her pretty eyes suddenly larger and brighter, though misting with embarrassment. I smiled but had no reply.

</p><p align="justify">
On the long drive home I wondered why she had told me this, but I was glad she did, for not knowing the reason is more than half the pleasure of being told a secret.
