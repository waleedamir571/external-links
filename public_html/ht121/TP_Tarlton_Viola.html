Trying to make up a story to go with this old photo, I went back and forth between what it made me think of in general—that it was a smiling young woman posed in a Persian alcove, showing a bit of ankle—but then, more specifically, that it was a photo of my mother. I don't remember her like this, of course; my childhood memories of her are sketchy, and she really doesn't come into complete focus until I was in high school and she and my father had settled into the numb and frustrating routines of approaching middle age.</p><p align='center'>
she died at eighty<br />
the age that I am now<br />
overtaking her<br />
we become ageless we two<br />
the old man with a boy's thoughts

</p><p align='center'>
time was the teacher<br />
taught her delicacy gets squashed<br />
by vulgarity<br />
by constant wear and banging<br />
by insensitivity

</p><p align='center'>
you can't throw little<br />
birds into a brawl of dogs<br />
snarling and biting<br />
who will sing the sweet songs then<br />
who kiss the gentle lips?

</p><p align="justify">

I don’t think the longing in that little smile was ever satisfied, much as she tried and dreamed. She was alone in that place, in what she craved, in the simple things. She dreamed of an old-world delicacy, of <em>politesse</em>, but rigid opinions, rough language, and prejudice make a corrosive strong enough to melt the strongest feelings down, peel away the thinnest skin. </p><p align='center'>
camera shutters snap<br />
the session's over. She comes down<br />
off her perch, a bird<br />
condemned to fly to the edge<br />
of the cage, against the bars

</p><p align='center'>
her beauty squandered<br />
even the wildest eagle<br />
falls in the forest<br />
unheard, becomes carrion  <br />
the end of its trajectory

</p><p align='center'>
from this moment's hope<br />
an empty but infinite<br />
possibility<br />
released untried unbroken<br />
like the flutter of dove wings
