										<p class="justify">The McVickers were the first ones. I played with their twin
											children in a sandbox behind one of the small houses on Lawrence Street.
											Clothes snapped on lines and dogs barked as we dug roads and planned farms
											in the soft sand. My parents gave permission and the McVickers brought me to
											Sunday School along with their own children. We cut out figures from paper,
											pasted them on popsicle sticks, gave them voices as we acted out stories the
											teacher taught us. One Sunday, I brought home a real flower for my mother.

										<p class="justify">A few years passed and we moved to Nassau Avenue where all
											the houses looked alike. We played ball in the field beside American
											Smelting and explored the woods that started at the end of our street. My
											Aunt Katherine lived a few blocks away and she brought me each week to her
											church. The Lutheran Church was on Park Avenue and it looked new with its
											modern design and roof like no other that I had seen. I attended classes
											there for one year. The teacher made me a shepherd in the Christmas program
											and I had to stand still like a statue and not say a word.</p>
										<p class="haikucenteritalic">late winter night<br />
											the psalm<br />
											breaks into pieces</p>
										<p class="justify">The last house we moved to was on Valley View Drive. I made
											friends with the Harris family down the street. There were five children and
											a grandfather living with Mr. and Mrs. Harris. There was laundry drying in
											their basement and a large vegetable garden in the backyard. At Christmas
											time, relatives came to their house and they all sang together. I would go
											with them once in a while to the Methodist Church on Main Street. The
											minister was old with a head of thick white hair. During the service, he
											asked all the children to come forward and sit around him as he told them a
											story. I was too old by then to step forward but I loved his stories about
											Mary and Joseph, the way his eyes lifted at times to the ceiling, and
											afterwards there was singing; the Harris family sang loudly. I picked up a
											hymnal, flipped to the right page, and sang softly so no one could hear.</p>
