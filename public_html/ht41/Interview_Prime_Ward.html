											This year sees the second edition of a delicate dance of wings, Linda
											Jeannette Ward’s book of haibun. Linda has published three books of poetry.
											Her work, including haiku, tanka, haibun and tanka prose, has been included
											in several anthologies and in many journals.</P>
										<P align="justify"><strong>PP:</strong> Perhaps you would begin by introducing
											yourself to readers who may not be familiar with your work? Would you like
											to provide the reader with a short biography, including your working life
											and your early interest and practice of writing?</P>
										<P align="Justify"><strong>LJW:</strong> I’m a native of Washington, D.C., where
											I spent my childhood. I attended North Carolina Wesleyan College for my BA
											and Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Virginia for a Master of Science in
											psychology. My first attempts at writing were in seventh grade where I won
											awards for short stories and essays. I began experimenting with haiku and
											free verse in graduate school, but did not begin writing as a daily practice
											until about 1996 when my first haiku was accepted by Bob Spiess at Modern
											Haiku. I fell in love with tanka when I first started reading Kenneth
											Rexroth’s translations, and shortly thereafter began entering and reading
											Jane Reichhold’s Tanka Splendor competitions. My early haibun included tanka
											and haiku, and were first published in Lynx (USA) and Raw NerVZ Haiku
											(Canada). I write at least one tanka a day as part of a Zen practice of
											mindfulness meditation.</P>
										<P align="justify"><strong>PP:</strong> You are interested in all the Japanese
											forms of short verse and have been particularly successful with your haiku.
											I enjoy the background to haiku that lies partly in the two-part structure
											and the challenges it presents. Can you say more about your interest in
											haiku?</P>
										<P align="Justify"><strong>LJW:</strong> Haiku is the most challenging poetry
											form for me. I almost always make imagistic sketches from nature as part of
											walking meditation, or from what I see from my studio window. Later, I’ll
											write the haiku from the sketches. Being a birder has influenced my
											observations of nature and my haiku writing by making me more aware of each
											moment and what it contains.</P>
										<P align="justify"><strong>PP:</strong> Could you say why you have reissued your
											book of haibun?</P>
										<P align="Justify"><strong>LJW:</strong> The first edition was a limited
											production and sold out quickly after receiving a Merit Book Award from the
											Haiku Society of America. Larry Kimmel, who published the book, offered to
											do a second printing and I agreed.</P>
										<P align="justify"><strong>PP:</strong> Do you have any plans to publish another
											book?</P>
										<P align="Justify"><strong>LJW:</strong> Yes, a manuscript of haiku is ready,
											but awaits recovery from a downturn in finances following a slow down in my
											work.</P>
										<P align="justify"><strong>PP:</strong> I think of method as a general approach
											to writing and technique as a specific means of composing an individual
											text. What makes you decide on any given occasion between writing tanka,
											haibun or tanka prose?</P>
										<P align="Justify"><strong>LJW:</strong> Every day is an occasion to write
											tanka, which for me is a medium for blending reality, imagination and
											dreams. The writing of haibun and tanka prose is more likely to be
											influenced by real events or observations than are my stand alone tanka. On
											those occasions when I write haibun, it’s usually because I’ve been touched
											by someone’s story or incident that I want to convey.</P>
										<P align="justify"><strong>PP:</strong> Do you feel there is a similarity
											between the three genres of tanka, haibun and tanka prose or do you feel
											that one form is of more importance than another?</P>
										<P align="Justify"><strong>LJW:</strong> I don’t think that one form is more
											important than the other, and that relative importance would vary depending
											on the poet, the poet’s mood, and what’s happening in the person’s life. As
											to similarity among the three forms, yes, all are concerned with human
											emotion, even if expressed by using nature as metaphor. All three can
											provide an outlet for loosely connected thoughts, memories and dreams to
											intertwine in new ways. All three can also be a way to express abstract
											beliefs like transience and emptiness.</P>
										<P align="justify"><strong>PP:</strong> I like the way there’s almost a dialogue
											between prose and poem, especially for a reader coming to these forms of
											poetry for the first time. Do you have any more thoughts on that?</P>
										<P align="Justify"><strong>LJW:</strong> My preference is for at least a slight
											shift between prose and poem, yet with a common thread that emerges with the
											creation of the piece as a whole. I think of the definition of Gestalt I was
											taught in college: the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.</P>
										<P align="justify"><strong>PP:</strong> Do you feel that you’re taking a risk by
											entering these different spaces? Is it quite important for you to remain
											open to risk as a writer?</P>
										<P align="Justify"><strong>LJW:</strong> Yes, writing prose with poetry is
											always exploratory for me. Yes, it’s very important for me to remain open to
											risk, not only as a writer, but as an approach to life.</P>
										<P align="justify"><strong>PP:</strong> I’ve been reading your book a delicate
											dance of wings and thinking about the lyrical aspect to your poems. What is
											the status of the lyric voice in your writing?</P>
										<P align="Justify"><strong>LJW:</strong> The unconscious is the source of the
											lyric voice in my writing. This is where the muse resides, the root of
											music. The tanka form, even in modern English, seems to have evolved
											especially for lyrical and rhythmic expression. I can easily appreciate that
											waka were originally sung. Prose too can be lyrical when the restrictions of
											the mechanics of grammar are only loosely adhered to.</P>
										<P align="justify"><strong>PP:</strong> The feeling of the poems in a delicate
											dance of wings is of very strong momentum and flow but there’s also a
											precision of placement in them. People may be tempted to say its just pure
											flow but at the same time there’s a weight and measure going on in the
											themes. Do you agree?</P>
										<P align="Justify"><strong>LJW:</strong> Yes, I agree that there is flow and
											placement or measure in these haibun. Most are tied to place, so that
											provides an anchor, but using free association to avoid a linear rut, the
											prose and poem hopefully flow together.</P>
										<P align="justify"><strong>PP:</strong> Sometimes it’s necessary to use endnotes
											or epigraphs in a poem. I’m thinking of your haibun “A Wilsonian Tale”
											because that’s unusual, or at least I haven’t seen you use endnotes or
											epigraphs on other occasions. How do you think they stand as statements to a
											poem?</P>
										<P align="Justify"><strong>LJW:</strong> I’ve used epigraphs twice that I can
											recall. In both cases it was because the person I quoted expressed what I
											also felt or believed. In “A Wilsonian Tale” the concept of biophilia
											described the bond that was formed with nature when I was a child spending
											holidays at my grandparents’ farm. Like Edward Wilson, I believe that the
											potential to form this bond is innate, and when missed, leaves a gap or
											deficit in one’s life. The other epigraph, from E. B. White, appeared in
											Scent of Jasmine and Brine, a tanka collection: “All writing is both a mask
											and an unveiling.”</P>
										<P align="justify"><strong>PP:</strong> There’s an idea that research stimulates
											ideas. Do you use journal, diary entries or other means that you then
											transform in certain ways?</P>
										<P align="Justify"><strong>LJW:</strong> I don’t keep a diary, but have
											occasionally kept a nature journal in the tradition of Thoreau. My ideas are
											stimulated from a blend of what I observe or read and what is generated by
											free association. Writing from the unconscious was a method (more of an
											unmethod, really) that I was inspired to use after reading Natalie
											Goldberg’s Writing Down the Bones and earlier, Dorothea Brande’s Becoming a
											Writer. My best writing comes when I write first thing when I wake up, with
											no editing or even sense to it at all. Later, I may refer back to earlier
											sketches that I made and blend these in with what the muse provided via free
											association and remnants of dreams.</P>
										<P align="justify"><strong>PP:</strong> You have been very active on the
											literary scene for a number of years. Do you have the opportunity to meet
											other tanka and haibun writers?</P>
										<P align="Justify"><strong>LJW:</strong> I seldom do because of where I live and
											limits on my ability to travel due to chronic health problems. I do keep in
											touch with several other writers, and have done tanka workshops as part of a
											literary grant from the N.C. Arts Council. This has been very stimulating,
											as participants have been teens who have not yet acquired the restrictions
											that sometimes slow down the flow.</P>
										<P align="justify"><strong>PP:</strong> Could you say something about your
											success in the Tanka Splendor contests?</P>
										<P align="Justify"><strong>LJW:</strong> Not specifically, but competitions in
											general provide motivation for me to more carefully edit my work; otherwise
											it might miss the polish and coherence that brings together the different
											parts. If competitions are truly judged anonymously, then there is the
											advantage that one’s work is being selected on merit and not because of your
											being a friend of the editor, or because of past reputation or acceptance.
											Jane Reichhold has upheld the highest standard in sponsoring Tanka Splendor,
											although my strong preference was for the winners to be printed in the
											wonderfully illustrated booklets she once published.</P>
										<P align="justify"><strong>PP:</strong> Tanka are usually written in fixed form,
											whereas the prose parts of haibun and tanka prose are free-flowing. Is it a
											conscious effort to switch from one genre to another?</P>
										<P align="Justify"><strong>LJW:</strong> Yes, it is a conscious effort on my
											part. I find prose difficult to initiate and need to do several drafts to
											warm up. Encouragement by other poets and editors is important for me to
											write prose, whereas that’s not true for tanka.</P>
										<P align="justify"><strong>PP:</strong> What are your literary projects at the
											moment?</P>
										<P align="Justify"><strong>LJW:</strong> Currently, my greatest emphasis is
											haibun and tanka prose. I’d like to expand the themes, content and voice
											expressed in my prose.</P>
										<P align="justify"><strong>PP:</strong> To end, Linda, I would like to thank you
											for agreeing to the interview and I’d like to complete it with two of your
											poems. The first, “<a href="Ward_Death.html">Death Wish</a>” appeals to me
											as I’ve recently been going through the grieving process and I like the
											expression “spills of life” which seems to sum up the accidents of fate. The
											second poem, “<a href="Ward_AWilsonian.html">A Wilsonian Tale</a>” contains
											the title of your book, and is also one of the only poems in the book that
											begins with an epigraph.
