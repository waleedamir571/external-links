										<p class="justify">I am using wood that was leftover from the new front steps to
											build a small boat. It is more like a wooden tub, no seat, just enough room
											for one person. My plan is to paddle it like a canoe. Grandfather is letting
											me use the hand tools that he keeps in the garage, and he has given me a can
											of paint, dark blue like the Sunoco Gas Stations, and a few letters to give
											the boat a name.</p>
										<p class="haikucenteritalic">orange lilies<br />
											families in flip-flops<br />
											march to the sea</p>
										<p class="justify">One end of each side board is cut at an angle so that the bow
											will come to a point. I am nailing one of those boards to the bottom when my
											great grandfather comes out the back door. No one else is home. He is
											wearing a shirt and tie, waving his hands at me, and speaking a mixture of
											German and English. I know what my great grandfather is trying to tell me,
											the sides are too low, the boat will sink, and I will drown. The urgency in
											his voice, the fear of something, frightens me, and I drop my hammer and run
											into<br />
											the house where I race up the narrow steps to the attic and hide under a
											bed.</p>
										<p class="haikucenteritalic">quiet summer<br />
											waves toss<br />
											a waterlogged ball</p>
										<p class="justify">Great Grandfather is shuffling from room to room. “Where are
											you? Where are you?” he asks again and again. I do not make a sound,
											suddenly afraid of the gentle man who paints songbirds on velvet. His voice
											comes and goes as he searches each bedroom and then the front porch.
											Finally, I hear his shoes on the attic steps. He climbs halfway up and asks,
											“Len, Len, are you up there?”</p>
										<p class="justify">“No,” I blurt out , and my great grandfather climbs slowly
											back down the steps.</p>
										<p class="justify">A few days pass, my family gathers on the shore to watch the
											launching of my blue boat. I climb in with my paddle and a few adults shove
											me out on the bay. I paddle twenty feet before the salty water covers my
											ankles then rises to my waist as the boat sinks beneath small waves. Two
											cousins wade in to help me drag it back to the sand.</p>
										<p class="haikucenteritalic">onshore breeze<br />
