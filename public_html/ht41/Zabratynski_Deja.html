It was a usual day, somewhere in the middle of the week. The entrance door creaked as if saying: “Keep away from here!” The empty<strong>waiting room</strong> greeted me with the pleasant coolness of air conditioning. Everything seemed to be in its place—a round low table in<strong>the</strong> centre of the room, colourful out-of-date magazines and comfortable sofas. I<strong>stopped</strong> near one of the sofas, sat down and waited for the doctor’s invitation to the surgery, where my decayed aching tooth was to be treated. There was a calendar hanging on the wall, near the<strong>clock</strong>. Somehow a calendar in any waiting room<strong>shows</strong> pretty women. This one wasn’t an exception. Unfortunately, somebody forgot to tear a page out and it still hung in<strong>the</strong> previous month. The shrill sound of drilling was coming from behind the door of the treatment room. I consoled myself with the thought that my friend, who had recommended the dentist to me, was sure that exactly that dentist was the<strong>right</strong> person to solve my tooth problem. Out of boredom, I started thumbing through the nearest magazine but, more or less in the middle, I put it back in disgust. The sound of drilling stopped and the<strong>time</strong> of my appointment approached inexorably. I glanced at the clock on the wall and suddenly felt that I had seen all that before.<p align="center"><em></em></p></td></tr></table><p></p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><hr noshade="noshade" /><p>&nbsp;</p></td><td width="10%" valign="top" bgcolor="#DDDFE4"><img src="../images_new/koi1_double_r.jpg" width="100" height="1000" alt="koi" /><br /><img src="../images_new/koi1_double_r.jpg" width="100" height="1000" alt="koi" /></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><map name="Links" id="Links"><area shape="rect" coords="97,205,245,227" href="https://haibuntoday.thehaikufoundation.org/htv3n1" alt="Current" /><area shape="rect" coords="251,206,460,228" href="https://haibuntoday.thehaikufoundation.org/htv3n1" alt="Contents" /><area shape="rect" coords="469,207,573,229" href="https://haibuntoday.thehaikufoundation.org/pages/about.html" alt="about" /><area shape="rect" coords="579,208,679,229" href="https://haibuntoday.thehaikufoundation.org/pages/archives.html" alt="archives" /><area shape="rect" coords="690,208,801,230" href="https://haibuntoday.thehaikufoundation.org/pages/resources.html" alt="resources" /><area shape="rect" coords="812,208,890,230" href="https://haibuntoday.thehaikufoundation.org/pages/search.html" alt="search" /><area shape="rect" coords="899,208,1039,230" href="https://haibuntoday.thehaikufoundation.org/pages/submissions.html" alt="submissions" /><area shape="rect" coords="183,76,275,124" href="index41.html" alt="current" /><area shape="rect" coords="278,76,364,123" href="https://haibuntoday.thehaikufoundation.org/pages/about.html" /><area shape="rect" coords="366,76,444,122" href="https://haibuntoday.thehaikufoundation.org/pages/archives.html" /><area shape="rect" coords="447,77,542,121" href="https://haibuntoday.thehaikufoundation.org/pages/resources.html" /><area shape="rect" coords="545,77,653,121" href="https://haibuntoday.thehaikufoundation.org/pages/submissions.html" /><area shape="rect" coords="656,76,730,122" href="https://haibuntoday.thehaikufoundation.org/pages/search.html" /></map></body></html>
