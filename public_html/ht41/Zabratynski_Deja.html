It was a usual day, somewhere in the middle of the week. The entrance door creaked as if saying: “Keep away from here!” The empty<strong>waiting room</strong> greeted me with the pleasant coolness of air conditioning. Everything seemed to be in its place—a round low table in<strong>the</strong> centre of the room, colourful out-of-date magazines and comfortable sofas. I<strong>stopped</strong> near one of the sofas, sat down and waited for the doctor’s invitation to the surgery, where my decayed aching tooth was to be treated. There was a calendar hanging on the wall, near the<strong>clock</strong>. Somehow a calendar in any waiting room<strong>shows</strong> pretty women. This one wasn’t an exception. Unfortunately, somebody forgot to tear a page out and it still hung in<strong>the</strong> previous month. The shrill sound of drilling was coming from behind the door of the treatment room. I consoled myself with the thought that my friend, who had recommended the dentist to me, was sure that exactly that dentist was the<strong>right</strong> person to solve my tooth problem. Out of boredom, I started thumbing through the nearest magazine but, more or less in the middle, I put it back in disgust. The sound of drilling stopped and the<strong>time</strong> of my appointment approached inexorably. I glanced at the clock on the wall and suddenly felt that I had seen all that before.<p align="center"><em></em></p></td></tr></table><p></p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><hr noshade="noshade" /><p>&nbsp;</p></td><td width="10%" valign="top" bgcolor="#
