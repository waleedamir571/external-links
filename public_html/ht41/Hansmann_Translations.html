									<td height="3838" valign="top">
										<p align="justify">I am wayless and these footsteps erupt into clouds. She has
											put into my mouth the last word they lit on, naming her, and saying her name
											is like imagining clouds without resemblance, cloudlessness reflected on the
											lake.</p>
										<hr align="center" width="20" noshade="noshade" />
										<p align="center"><em>walks among boulders and rain<br />
												silence and hawks violent downwind</em></p>
										<hr align="center" width="20" noshade="noshade" />
										<p align="justify">A wave at wary distance. She scared me into my childhood
											once, an abandoned coal bin, our fingers in the dust. Instead of a kiss we
											draw in the flesh a black X mustache above each other’s lip. In dream or
											memory or now, under the fence ahead of the horns, morning taking its
											chances.</p>
										<hr align="center" width="20" noshade="noshade" />
										<p align="center"><em>a glittering golden fry<br />
												lugged from a fat potato</em></p>
										<hr align="center" width="20" noshade="noshade" />
										<p align="justify">Coming down to the lights I question: Why are these postcards
											in Latin? Ruin through my heart and your tongue on the roof of my mouth is
											ancient rubble. We stumble long distance our usual cradle-grave way, our
											waylessness paved with pinpoints of map. Not you at my side? Don’t call and
											tell me who.</p>
										<hr align="center" width="20" noshade="noshade" />
										<p align="center"><em>knees that ignore the hardwood gloss<br />
												a mapping of boots on the southern coast</em></p>
										<hr align="center" width="20" noshade="noshade" />
										<p align="justify">Windstorm. We went to the cellar. Our awnings leaked and the
											gutters (like those supposedly in cities supposedly under the falls) flooded
											the shallow cistern. The water rose to the ceiling. We felt it in our ears.
											It was time to go upstairs.</p>
										<hr align="center" width="20" noshade="noshade" />
										<p align="center"><em>spilled perfume and the burnt<br />
												edge of a note on your door</em></p>
										<hr align="center" width="20" noshade="noshade" />
										<p align="justify">Clarity is a copied idea. She thought this reflection hers.
											It stood directly in front of her, dim in the glass door of a leaning
											display case, the pane off kilter, the image crooked. She didn’t know I was
											standing there.</p>
										<hr align="center" width="20" noshade="noshade" />
										<p align="center"><em>day off, paid<br />
												the pinched-nose call-in</em></p>
										<hr align="center" width="20" noshade="noshade" />
										<p align="justify">The moonbeam rounds itself off. We stand at the end and call
											it even, nothing to carry, nothing left over, light going its many ways
											among divided shadows.</p>
										<hr align="center" width="20" noshade="noshade" />
										<p align="center"><em>across town and down<br />
												the city’s transportation like a puzzle clue</em></p>
										<hr align="center" width="20" noshade="noshade" />
										<p align="justify">Where you are yet or interpenetrate the rarity of lying
											inside these countless sunshines—something glitters there, like netted
											recurrences. Never mind the river twice; upstream it never passes here.</p>
										<hr align="center" width="20" noshade="noshade" />
										<p align="center"><em>one night from full<br />
												new decade’s first</em></p>
										<hr align="center" width="20" noshade="noshade" />
										<p align="justify">A kiss out on its own upgraded wisdom makes out tumultuous
											whereabouts. Weather without anywhere to go upturns the stagnant handiwork,
											stretches of enormity rolling through the hollow.</p>
										<hr align="center" width="20" noshade="noshade" />
										<p align="center"><em>elbows and low windowsill<br />
												our bellies fill the mattress</em></p>
										<hr align="center" width="20" noshade="noshade" />
										<p align="justify">Asleep or only dreamily we drink from our reflections, though
											they are only the colors of flowers the streams oblige them, butterflies
											waiting to rust from flecks in ferrous stone, embedded affinities outlasting
											our astonishment.</p>
										<hr align="center" width="20" noshade="noshade" />
										<p align="center"><em>shouting like a weekday<br />
												silent as a month</em></p>
										<hr align="center" width="20" noshade="noshade" />
										<p align="justify">Something happens again the moment the wait puts on hold
											wondering what it will be. You are impatient though I feel rushed,
											predisposed to infinite fussiness. The offers are endless and each as good.
											Your choice is quick; I would make do with the next.</p>
										<hr align="center" width="20" noshade="noshade" />
										<p align="center"><em>Tuesday, August—they can’t help<br />
												what their parents named them</em></p>
										<hr align="center" width="20" noshade="noshade" />
										<p align="justify">When we put out in what would prove our bottle, the
											grape-juice sea had not fermented, gifts were solid—no laminated trick
											trumped siege with stealth—and sly transportation made us into something
											else. We wake up sacked, and last I looked you followed, last I saw you.</p>
										<hr align="center" width="20" noshade="noshade" />
										<p align="center"><em>the warped mirror where your disappearance<br />
												begins its search</em></p>
										<hr align="center" width="20" noshade="noshade" />
										<p align="justify">River round, its run this floating pool of mood. Windfall,
											apple hung along the peeled road. Fruit famous in song lets go our hold. A
											number divided by one counts itself told.</p>
										<hr align="center" width="20" noshade="noshade" />
										<p align="center"><em>the whoosh out of wind into vacuum<br />
												past the refastening semi parked on the shoulder</em></p>
										<hr align="center" width="20" noshade="noshade" />
										<p align="justify">One drink of this hot air leaves steep shadows on the
											flatland. No canteen can carry the way they lean. We’re tricked to climb,
											closing the distance with open arms.</p>
										<hr align="center" width="20" noshade="noshade" />
										<p align="center"><em>your limbs or agile chopsticks<br />
												the plum wine breathless</em></p>
										<hr align="center" width="20" noshade="noshade" />
										<p align="justify">Our gutters are galvanized troughs draining our horsehide
											awnings. There’s a wind-driven pump that is pouring over the rim to the
											dust. Our gates all lead to the water we are always willing to drink, wind
											rearing up in the leather, the galloping hooves of rain.</p>
										<hr align="center" width="20" noshade="noshade" />
										<p align="center"><em>warmed through glass<br />
												in the empty mansard</em></p>
										<hr align="center" width="20" noshade="noshade" />
										<p align="justify">Black water, suggestive ink, testing us by shape alone,
											floats upon itself the way the great poems cock their ears to see if they
											are listening. We watch the lines of a careful horse emerge from the fog
											into which it vanishes, you who say the rider never saw us, I who saw that
											it wasn’t mounted.</p>
										<hr align="center" width="20" noshade="noshade" />
										<p align="center"><em>stainless, doffed<br />
												canister lid O’d fingers flash</em></p>
										<hr align="center" width="20" noshade="noshade" />
										<p align="justify">Only looking away relieves this consistency, interchangeable
											parts of which some say there are none, bartered parts reclaiming past
											exchanges, the things we’re running out of.</p>
										<hr align="center" width="20" noshade="noshade" />
										<p align="center"><em>fresh juice, wok’d veggies, at-desk isometrics<br />
												the twist-offs, the fuck-ups, the fears-of</em></p>
										<hr align="center" width="20" noshade="noshade" />
										<p align="justify" class="textjustify">We stumble into memory, that chronic
											stubbed toe, side-stepping the bruises where the potholes reminisce—an
											intercepted once-over, your eyes too bold to watch your step.</p>
										<hr align="center" width="20" noshade="noshade" />
										<p align="center" class="haikucentereditalics"><em>whaling, mousing<br />
												whatever your druthers</em></p>
										<hr align="center" width="20" noshade="noshade" />
										<p align="justify">No choice but straight. This alley branches only into
											trashcans—the stick you brandish ticking our pace at intervals—minutes after
											pickup, lids askew, hungry cats watching.</p>
										<hr align="center" width="20" noshade="noshade" />
										<p align="center"><em>the sunken couch<br />
												a neck like knees</em></p>
										<hr align="center" width="20" noshade="noshade" />
										<p align="justify">Something celery, her stalk, but a kind of concentrate,
											juiced, a cluster dissolving into froth between tooth and tooth. Something
											stringy caught poised on the edge, our waiting nudged toward onrush.</p>
										<hr align="center" width="20" noshade="noshade" />
										<p align="center"><em>a dozen halved oranges<br />
												a pint of juice apiece</em></p>
										<hr align="center" width="20" noshade="noshade" />
										<p align="justify">Leaving creature-ness is what they call absence. Arrival
											stands at future’s brink. And being here merely that we are leaving no
											remainder, all words beginning with A to be absorbed in.</p>
										<hr align="center" width="20" noshade="noshade" />
										<p align="center"><em>held breath and sea-salt eyes<br />
												the kite fish, the underwater tree</em></p>
										<hr align="center" width="20" noshade="noshade" />
										<p align="justify">Breath was windless, darkness hiding darkness. From this
											protection opposites broke free, unity took count of throb and pulse. The
											myth declares itself uncertain whether this was produced or happened.</p>
										<hr align="center" width="20" noshade="noshade" />
										<p align="center" id="em"><em>the coiled and charming<br />
												hypnosis of her turban</em></p>
										<hr align="center" width="20" noshade="noshade" />
										<p align="justify">Poems that restore belief, that reviewers find compassionate,
											unflinchingly honest—the world will not unfold there, shining, indelible,
											enduring. There is dust on the shelf-life of reading. Posterity prefers our
											graffiti.</p>
										<hr align="center" width="20" noshade="noshade" />
										<p align="center"><em>a spectacular jump<br />
												the landing still not in sight</em></p>
										<hr align="center" width="20" noshade="noshade" />
										<p align="justify">Years will probably go by, she said, always so proud of her
											prophecies. She knocked and I held my finger to my lips so the girl in my
											bed wouldn’t give us away with a giggle. Silence both sides of the door.
											There were so many ways I could tell her. I said the same thing over and
											over.</p>
										<hr align="center" width="20" noshade="noshade" />
										<p align="center"><em>the salted silent clamp<br />
												that takes in sand and rounding</em></p>
										<hr align="center" width="20" noshade="noshade" />
										<p align="justify">As if she lived by theory, sudsing up in the learning
											cauldron instead of submerged in the bath. Start one as if start two. Where
											are you going, wallpaper of birds? This is where the room will smell its
											flowers, writing them like mad, a penny for your pencil point.</p>
