comes in by the window<br />

go slowly, alone—<br />
the wind, the moon</em><P align="justify">Off Portuguese Bend the fish fill the ship-littered basins, they turn in shoals and fly like clouds before a gale down the steep, restless canyons of the sea bed: a fierce profusion, mindless of hierarchies, that some men find troubling, or leave troubled. I have been of both minds, and now think a man might take his own bad dreams and join them, leaping into the glimmer below the cliffs at Palos Verdes, hoping to know their careless and immortal moment, the thing a man cannot know; ten thousand years the poets have tried.  A dismaying knowledge: the best poems end in silence.<P align="center"><em>no other sound<br />
but the chain on the gate,<br />
the rattle it makes—</em><P align="justify">Outside your clapboard cottage on Jefferson Street you keep an all-weather animal repeller with motion sensor, and live secure with just that, nothing fancy. Your arguments with the world are small arguments, therefore also may be the more noble. I do not know. The world is strange.<P align="justify">I am parked in my car on a windy bluff where old Nike missile batteries stand as mausoleums formed of iron and concrete, dug into the rock palisades. I can see our mechanical guardian, the Point Fermin light, where another answer is made to the blind gods – a thin, sharp beam, a line cast outward like a whip upon the dark, soft chaos: mute as an oyster, my friend.<P align="justify"><hr align="left" width="200" noshade="noshade" /><P> "Point Fermin Light" was first published in<em>Raw Nerves</em> VIII:1, 2002<p>&nbsp;</P></tr></table><hr noshade="noshade" /><p>&nbsp;</p></td><td width="10%" valign="top" bgcolor="#
