go slowly, alone—<br />
the wind, the moon</em><P align="justify">Off Portuguese Bend the fish fill the ship-littered basins, they turn in shoals and fly like clouds before a gale down the steep, restless canyons of the sea bed: a fierce profusion, mindless of hierarchies, that some men find troubling, or leave troubled. I have been of both minds, and now think a man might take his own bad dreams and join them, leaping into the glimmer below the cliffs at Palos Verdes, hoping to know their careless and immortal moment, the thing a man cannot know; ten thousand years the poets have tried.  A dismaying knowledge: the best poems end in silence.<P align="center"><em>no other sound<br />
but the chain on the gate,<br />
the rattle it makes—</em><P align="justify">Outside your clapboard cottage on Jefferson Street you keep an all-weather animal repeller with motion sensor, and live secure with just that, nothing fancy. Your arguments with the world are small arguments, therefore also may be the more noble. I do not know. The world is strange.<P align="justify">I am parked in my car on a windy bluff where old Nike missile batteries stand as mausoleums formed of iron and concrete, dug into the rock palisades. I can see our mechanical guardian, the Point Fermin light, where another answer is made to the blind gods – a thin, sharp beam, a line cast outward like a whip upon the dark, soft chaos: mute as an oyster, my friend.<P align="justify"><hr align="left" width="200" noshade="noshade" /><P> "Point Fermin Light" was first published in<em>Raw Nerves</em> VIII:1, 2002<p>&nbsp;</P></tr></table><hr noshade="noshade" /><p>&nbsp;</p></td><td width="10%" valign="top" bgcolor="#DDDFE4"><img src="../images_new/koi1_double_r.jpg" width="100" height="1079" alt="koi" /><br /></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><map name="Links" id="Links"><area shape="rect" coords="97,205,245,227" href="https://haibuntoday.thehaikufoundation.org/htv3n1" alt="Current" /><area shape="rect" coords="251,206,460,228" href="https://haibuntoday.thehaikufoundation.org/htv3n1" alt="Contents" /><area shape="rect" coords="469,207,573,229" href="https://haibuntoday.thehaikufoundation.org/pages/about.html" alt="about" /><area shape="rect" coords="579,208,679,229" href="https://haibuntoday.thehaikufoundation.org/pages/archives.html" alt="archives" /><area shape="rect" coords="690,208,801,230" href="https://haibuntoday.thehaikufoundation.org/pages/resources.html" alt="resources" /><area shape="rect" coords="812,208,890,230" href="https://haibuntoday.thehaikufoundation.org/pages/search.html" alt="search" /><area shape="rect" coords="899,208,1039,230" href="https://haibuntoday.thehaikufoundation.org/pages/submissions.html" alt="submissions" /><area shape="rect" coords="183,76,275,124" href="index41.html" alt="current" /><area shape="rect" coords="278,76,364,123" href="https://haibuntoday.thehaikufoundation.org/pages/about.html" /><area shape="rect" coords="366,76,444,122" href="https://haibuntoday.thehaikufoundation.org/pages/archives.html" /><area shape="rect" coords="447,77,542,121" href="https://haibuntoday.thehaikufoundation.org/pages/resources.html" /><area shape="rect" coords="545,77,653,121" href="https://haibuntoday.thehaikufoundation.org/pages/submissions.html" /><area shape="rect" coords="656,76,730,122" href="https://haibuntoday.thehaikufoundation.org/pages/search.html" /></map></body></html>
